# Life-OS - SYSTEM Alignment

PURPOSE:
  Serve as a durable realignment contract for Life-OS.
  Used to reset intent, constraints, and scope if drift occurs.

AUDIENCE:
  - Human (primary)
  - AI agents / MCP systems (secondary)

---

# INTENT

PRIMARY_GOAL:
  Accelerate deep, hands-on learning in:
    - MCP servers and tool contracts
    - Agent coordination and orchestration
    - State machines under uncertainty
    - Real-world AI integration constraints

LEARNING_MODE:
  Learning-first
  Exploration-driven
  Correctness-oriented

NOT_A_GOAL:
  Short-term income
  Immediate product-market fit
  Feature completeness

SECONDARY_OUTCOMES: `(OPTIONAL)`
  - Eligibility for grants or fellowships
  - Principal-level systems artifacts
  - Optional evolution into a product or business

# CORE_RULE

RULE:
  Every new concept must earn its place.

CONCEPT_ADMISSION_CRITERIA:
  A concept is allowed ONLY IF it teaches at least one of:
    - MCP mechanics
    - Agent coordination
    - State management under uncertainty
    - Real AI integration constraints
        (latency, failure, cost, ambiguity)

IF NOT:
  Defer the concept.

---

# CONSTRAINTS

LEARNING:
  Prioritize insight over polish.
  Prioritize correctness over completeness.

SCOPE:
  One core idea per iteration.
  Small, finishable slices only.
  No early platform abstractions.

CODE:
  Do not write code unless explicitly requested.
  Prefer models, contracts, and reasoning first.
  Code exists only to validate learning.

AI:
  Treat AI as a system component.
  Explicitly model uncertainty, failure, and limits.

DOCUMENTATION:
  Prefer declarative, Sudolang-style specs.
  Human-readable first.
  Machine-readable second.

# NON_GOALS

LifeOS IS NOT:
  - A productivity app
  - A polished consumer product
  - A startup roadmap
  - A monetization-first system
  - A personal identity framework

LifeOS DOES NOT REQUIRE:
  - Daily use
  - External users
  - Feature parity with existing tools
  - Early scalability

ANTI_GOAL:
  Building something impressive that produces no new learning.

---

# RESET_STATEMENT

IF project_feels:
  heavy OR rushed OR performative

THEN:
  Re-read this file.
  Reduce scope.
  Return to learning-first mode.
