# PHASE_2_RNA — INTENT

PURPOSE:
  Define how Life-OS turns meaning into safe action.
  Formalize proposals, validation, and execution boundaries
  before any code or storage decisions.

SCOPE:
  This phase defines:
    - what it means to ACT
    - how an AGENT proposes action
    - how proposals are validated against invariants
    - how execution is bounded, attributed, and reversible (semantically)

  This phase does NOT define:
    - UI
    - database schema
    - MCP implementation
    - RAG
    - multi-agent swarms
    - theming / lore / presentation

PRIMARY_OUTPUTS:
  - proposal_contract
  - validation_contract
  - execution_model (bounded)
  - core_workflows (paper-executed)
  - phase_fundamentals (compressed truths)

---

# CORE_QUESTION

QUESTION:
  "How does something ACT in the system without violating meaning?"

---

# EXECUTION_MODEL (RNA)

MODEL:
  DNA defines:
    - entities
    - states
    - invariants
    - trust levels

  RNA defines:
    - proposals (intent to change meaning)
    - validation (invariants enforcement)
    - execution (bounded effects)
    - attribution (who caused meaning to change)
    - semantic_reversibility (revoking authority and downstream trust)

RULE:
  No meaning becomes actionable without passing validation.

---

# ACTION_UNIT

ACTION_UNIT:
  PROPOSAL

RULE:
  Agents propose.
  The system validates.
  The system commits or rejects.

---

# PROPOSAL_CONTRACT (DRAFT)

FIELDS:
  - INTENT:
  - TARGET_ENTITY:
  - TARGET_SELECTOR:
  - ACTOR:
  - TARGET_SCOPE:
  - DEPENDENCIES:
  - IMPACT:
  - REVERSIBILITY_CLAIM:

RULE:
  TARGET describes what is acted upon.
  OUTPUT describes what is created.
  SCOPE describes where outputs may land.

---

# VALIDATION_CONTRACT (DRAFT)

VALIDATION_MUST_CHECK:
  - permissions (actor allowed)
  - scope (write boundaries)
  - invariant_safety (cannot violate meaning)
  - trust_escalation_rules (what becomes actionable)
  - provenance (attribution and sources)
  - reversibility_semantics (downstream revocation plan)

VALIDATION_OUTCOMES:
  - APPROVE
  - REJECT
  - PARTIAL_APPROVE (requires explicit constraints)
  - ESCALATE (needs human confirmation)

RULE:
  Fail_closed by default.

---

# SAFE_ACTING_DEFINITION

SAFE_ACTING:
  Acting safely means:
    - not exceeding granted authority
    - not creating trusted meaning by accident
    - stopping when justification is missing
    - leaving an audit trail that explains the action

---

# PHASE_SUCCESS_CRITERIA

SUCCESS_IF:
  The human can paper-execute the following workflows end-to-end
  and explain why each step is safe:

  WORKFLOWS:
    - weekly_reflection synthesis
    - denied_action example (blocked by invariants)
    - partial_approval example (narrowed scope)
    - undo_flow example (semantic revocation, not deletion)

AND:
  The human can answer:
    - "why is this agent allowed to act?"
    - "what exactly is it acting on?"
    - "what invariant prevents silent corruption?"
    - "what does undo mean here?"

---

# LEARNING_RULES

RULE:
  No code unless explicitly requested.

RULE:
  Each session must force the human to decide.
  If the human only reviews, the phase is failing.

RULE:
  Each major insight becomes fundamentals (3–7 bullets),
  with a 🍰 super_simple line.

---

# FOLLOW_UP (DEFERRED)

DEFERRED_TOPICS:
  - theming and lore overlays
  - expression rendering
  - external integrations (MCP, LLM APIs)
  - long-term DNA/RNA/Expression repo splitting

RULE:
  These are downstream and must not alter authority or invariants.
