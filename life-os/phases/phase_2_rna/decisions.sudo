# PHASE_2_RNA — DECISIONS

PURPOSE:
  Capture irreversible design commitments about how action,
  validation, and authority work in Life-OS.

RULE:
  Every decision here trades power for safety.
  If a decision feels “obvious,” it must be justified.

---

# DECISION_1 — WHAT CAN INITIATE ACTION?

QUESTION:
  Who is allowed to initiate a PROPOSAL?

OPTIONS:
  A) USER only
  B) AGENT only
  C) USER and AGENT (distinct authority)
  D) SYSTEM events (timers, state transitions)
  E) Combination (must specify precedence)

CHOICE:
  [REQUIRED]

RATIONALE:
  Why this choice does NOT allow silent authority escalation.

REJECTED_OPTIONS:
  - [OPTION]: reason rejected

INVARIANT_IMPLIED:
  The system must be able to answer:
    "Why was this action attempted at all?"

---

# DECISION_2 — WHERE VALIDATION LIVES

QUESTION:
  Where does proposal validation occur?

OPTIONS:
  A) Inside the AGENT
  B) Inside a central VALIDATION_ENGINE
  C) Distributed across entities
  D) Human-in-the-loop always
  E) Hybrid (must specify boundary)

CHOICE:
  [REQUIRED]

RATIONALE:
  Why validation cannot be bypassed.

FAILURE_MODE_IF_WRONG:
  What silently breaks if this assumption fails?

---

# DECISION_3 — WHAT A PROPOSAL IS ALLOWED TO TOUCH

QUESTION:
  What does TARGET_ENTITY mean precisely?

OPTIONS:
  A) A single entity instance
  B) A collection defined by selector
  C) A semantic class (e.g. MEMORY)
  D) All of the above (must define constraints)

CHOICE:
  [REQUIRED]

RATIONALE:
  Why TARGET ≠ OUTPUT.

INVARIANT_IMPLIED:
  Targets describe meaning under consideration,
  not artifacts being created.

---

# DECISION_4 — SCOPE VS AUTHORITY

QUESTION:
  What does TARGET_SCOPE actually constrain?

OPTIONS:
  A) Filesystem / storage paths
  B) Entity namespaces
  C) Execution side-effects
  D) All of the above (layered)

CHOICE:
  [REQUIRED]

RATIONALE:
  Why scope limits *where* effects land,
  not *what* is allowed.

FAILURE_MODE_IF_CONFUSED:
  Describe a concrete authority leak.

---

# DECISION_5 — REVERSIBILITY DEFINITION

QUESTION:
  What does it mean to "undo" an action?

OPTIONS:
  A) Delete created artifacts
  B) Roll back state transitions
  C) Revoke semantic authority
  D) Invalidate downstream meaning
  E) Combination (must specify ordering)

CHOICE:
  [REQUIRED]

RATIONALE:
  Why physical deletion alone is insufficient.

INVARIANT_IMPLIED:
  Downstream meaning must not remain trusted by accident.

---

# DECISION_6 — FAILURE BEHAVIOR

QUESTION:
  What happens when validation is inconclusive?

OPTIONS:
  A) Fail open (warn only)
  B) Fail closed (block)
  C) Partial approval
  D) Escalate to human
  E) Context-dependent (must define rules)

CHOICE:
  [REQUIRED]

RATIONALE:
  Why uncertainty must reduce power, not increase it.

---

# DECISION_7 — ATTRIBUTION

QUESTION:
  How is responsibility recorded?

OPTIONS:
  A) Actor only
  B) Actor + source MEMORY
  C) Actor + proposal snapshot
  D) Full provenance chain

CHOICE:
  [REQUIRED]

RATIONALE:
  Why attribution must survive deletion.

---

# DECISION_8 — AGENT STOP CONDITIONS

QUESTION:
  When must an AGENT stop acting?

OPTIONS:
  A) On validation failure
  B) On missing justification
  C) On invariant violation
  D) On ambiguity
  E) All of the above

CHOICE:
  [REQUIRED]

RATIONALE:
  Why “trying anyway” is forbidden.

---

# META_DECISION — WHAT IS DEFERRED

EXPLICITLY_DEFERRED:
  - theming
  - UI
  - persistence details
  - RAG
  - multi-agent coordination

RATIONALE:
  Why deferring these protects correctness.

# PHASE_EXIT_CRITERIA

THIS FILE IS COMPLETE WHEN:
  - Every CHOICE is filled
  - Every rejected option has a reason
  - At least one decision felt uncomfortable
  - You can explain how one bad choice here would corrupt meaning silently
