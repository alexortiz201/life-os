# PHASE_2_RNA — LEARNINGS

PURPOSE:
  Capture irreversible mental shifts earned during Phase 2.
  These are not explanations of the system,
  but changes in how action, authority, and trust are understood.

SCOPE:
  - validation
  - execution
  - commit
  - agents
  - meaning → action boundaries

---

LEARNING_1:
  STATEMENT:
    Validation, execution, and commit are distinct problems,
    not stages of the same problem.

  WHAT_CHANGED:
    I previously treated validation as a gate before execution.
    I now understand validation as a trust check,
    execution as effect production,
    and commit as belief formation.

  WHY_THIS_MATTERS:
    Collapsing these creates silent corruption
    where the system believes things it never safely earned.

LEARNING_2:
  STATEMENT:
    Commit is the moment meaning becomes authoritative,
    not the moment bytes are written.

  WHAT_CHANGED:
    I previously associated commit with storage or artifact creation.
    I now understand commit as the system agreeing
    to stand behind new meaning.

  WHY_THIS_MATTERS:
    Physical deletion cannot undo belief.
    Authority must be revoked semantically.

  TAGS:
    - authority
    - meaning
    - reversibility

LEARNING_3:
  STATEMENT:
    Re-validation is not redundancy; it is protection against time.

  WHAT_CHANGED:
    I initially saw re-validation as wasted effort.
    I now understand it as necessary because assumptions decay,
    even in fast systems.

  WHY_THIS_MATTERS:
    Without re-validation, stale assumptions become truth.

  TAGS:
    - invariants
    - time
    - safety

LEARNING_4:
  STATEMENT:
    Agents must never be trusted actors.

  WHAT_CHANGED:
    I stopped thinking of agents as safe executors.
    I now treat them as proposal generators only.

  WHY_THIS_MATTERS:
    Allowing agents to act directly
    creates silent authority escalation.

    - authority

LEARNING_5:
  STATEMENT:
    Meaning becomes more dangerous as it becomes more trusted.

  WHAT_CHANGED:
    I now see trust as a gradient,
    where each increase requires stronger invariants.

  WHY_THIS_MATTERS:
    Systems fail most dangerously near commit.
