# WEEKLY_REFLECTION — WORKFLOW RATIONALE

PURPOSE:
  Explain why `weekly_reflection` is the chosen paper-execution workflow for Phase 3.
  Capture tradeoffs and what this workflow stress-tests in the RNA pipeline.

SCOPE:
  Rationale only.
  This file does NOT define rules beyond the spec.

# WHY_THIS_WORKFLOW

REASON:
  Weekly reflection is a “meaning transformation” workflow:
    MEMORY → NOTE → (optional) ARTIFACT

WHY_IT_IS_GOOD_EARLY:
  - It touches multiple MEMORY items (time window selector)
  - It creates a human-facing output
  - It tempts us to treat AI output as “truth”
  - It naturally tests provisional vs committed meaning

---

# WHAT_IT_STRESS_TESTS

STRESS_TESTS:
  - TARGET vs OUTPUT correctness
  - permission gating over collections (MEMORY set)
  - “no trust before commit” invariant
  - audit chain completeness
  - re-validation necessity (stale assumptions)

---

# TRADEOFFS

TRADEOFF_1:
  Using time_window selectors adds power, but increases risk:
    - selector bugs can cause the wrong MEMORY set to be used
    - re-validation must ensure the selector is still valid

TRADEOFF_2:
  Writing NOTE during execution is useful, but dangerous:
    - it must remain provisional
    - external systems must not treat it as authoritative pre-commit

TRADEOFF_3:
  Optional ARTIFACT output increases meaning risk:
    - artifacts often become referenced by other workflows
    - invalidation must consider downstream links

---

# WHY_REVALIDATION_MATTERS_HERE

RATIONALE:
  This workflow is the canonical example where:
    - a time window can shift
    - permissions can be revoked mid-run
    - the system context can change
    - execution can succeed under assumptions that are no longer true

CLAIM:
  If re-validation is removed,
  commit can silently ratify stale or unauthorized meaning.

---

# FAILURE_MODES_IF_WRONG

IF_TARGET_IS_WRONG:
  The system validates the wrong thing and commits corrupted meaning.

IF_EXECUTION_IMPLICITLY_COMMITS:
  Undo becomes impossible at meaning level, even if bytes are deleted.

IF_REVALIDATION_IS_SKIPPED:
  The system commits under stale permissions or stale invariants.

IF_AUDIT_CHAIN_IS_INCOMPLETE:
  The system cannot explain why it believes what it believes.

---

# SUPER_SIMPLE

SUMMARY:
  Weekly reflection looks harmless.
  That’s why it’s a perfect test:
  harmless workflows are where systems start lying.
