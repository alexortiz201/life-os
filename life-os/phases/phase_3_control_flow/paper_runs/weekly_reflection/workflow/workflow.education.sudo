# WEEKLY_REFLECTION — WORKFLOW EDUCATION

PURPOSE:
  Teach how to read and pressure-test the weekly reflection workflow spec.
  Provide recall hooks for the universal system problem this workflow represents.

SCOPE:
  Education only.
  This file does NOT add rules beyond the spec.

# CACHE_WARM

WHAT_LAYER:
  RNA

UNIVERSAL_PROBLEM:
  Turn intent into action without letting “work performed” become “truth believed”.

RECALL_HOOKS:
  MNEMONICS:
    - "Validate → Try → Re-check → Believe"
    - "Effects are not meaning"
    - "Commit creates belief"

  INVARIANT_REMINDERS:
    - No trust before commit
    - Every trust boundary requires a check
    - Outputs are provisional until proven safe

  QUESTIONS:
    - What is the TARGET (acted on) vs OUTPUT (created)?
    - What can change between validation and commit?
    - If we halt here, did meaning change?

CONTEXT_SPECIFICITY:
  AGENTS
  AI_INTEGRATION
  SYSTEMS

FAILURE_MODE:
  - Silent corruption: execution implies truth
  - Stale authority: assumptions change mid-flight
  - Trust leak: provisional outputs treated as committed

# HOW_TO_READ_THIS_WORKFLOW

READING_ORDER:
  1. Identify the TARGET_ENTITY + TARGET_SELECTOR
  2. Track which artifacts are created at each stage
  3. Ask: "Where does trust increase?"
  4. Verify: "Trust increases only at COMMIT"
  5. Verify: "Every earlier stage is safe to halt"

KEY_DISTINCTION:
  - NOTE may be written during EXECUTION
  - but NOTE is not trusted until COMMIT

INTERPRETATION:
  - Weekly reflection is “meaning synthesis”
  - The danger is treating “a generated summary” as “a system belief”
  - The pipeline exists to prevent that jump

# WHAT_THIS_WORKFLOW_TEACHES

TEACHES:
  - TARGET is MEMORY (inputs), not NOTE/ARTIFACT (outputs)
  - EXECUTION can write objects without granting authority
  - RE-VALIDATION is required because permissions and context can change
  - COMMIT is the only boundary where meaning becomes trusted

---

# SUPER_SIMPLE

SUMMARY:
  You can write drafts.
  You can produce effects.
  But nothing counts as truth until the system commits.
