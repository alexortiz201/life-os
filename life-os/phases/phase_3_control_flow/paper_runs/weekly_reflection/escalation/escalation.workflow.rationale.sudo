PURPOSE:
  Explain the design rationale for escalation.

---

# RATIONALE

WHY ESCALATION IS REQUIRED:
  Some proposals cannot be validated automatically without guessing user intent
  or accepting unacceptable risk.

WHY HUMAN DECISION MUST BE AN ARTIFACT:
  Without a durable record:
    - accountability disappears
    - later audits become storytelling
    - trust can drift silently

WHY HUMAN DECISION DOES NOT BYPASS INVARIANTS:
  Humans can authorize intent,
  but the system must still enforce safety boundaries.

WHAT SILENTLY BREAKS IF WRONG:
  - agents start “asking forgiveness” by acting first
  - sensitive memory is consumed or summarized without consent
  - high-trust surfaces get polluted by unreviewed AI content

🍰 SUPER SIMPLE:
  Escalation prevents the system from guessing
  when guessing would be dangerous.
