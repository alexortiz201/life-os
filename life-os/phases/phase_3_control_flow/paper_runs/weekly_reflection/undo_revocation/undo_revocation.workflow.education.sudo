# weekly_reflection.undo_revocation.workflow.education.sudo

PURPOSE:
  Teach semantic undo vs physical deletion.

---

# CACHE WARM

WHAT_LAYER:
  RNA

UNIVERSAL_PROBLEM:
  Undoing decisions safely when effects have already propagated.

RECALL_HOOKS:
  MNEMONICS:
    - "Undo = revoke trust"
    - "Delete bytes ≠ delete consequences"
    - "Revocation is new meaning"

  INVARIANT_REMINDERS:
    - downstream meaning must not remain trusted by accident
    - revocation must be attributable and durable
    - invalidation must propagate

  QUESTIONS:
    - what depends on this meaning?
    - what becomes unsafe if it stays trusted?
    - what does “undo” mean to the rest of the system?

CONTEXT_SPECIFICITY:
  SYSTEMS
  STATE_AND_INVARIANTS
  AGENTS

FAILURE_MODE:
  “Undo” deletes the note but keeps plans, dashboards, or decisions trusted
  System continues acting on revoked meaning
  Audit trail can’t explain why trust changed

# TEACHING NOTES

UNDO IS A COMMIT:
  You are committing new meaning:
    "That prior meaning is no longer trusted."

🍰 SUPER SIMPLE:
  Undo doesn’t erase.
  Undo un-approves.
