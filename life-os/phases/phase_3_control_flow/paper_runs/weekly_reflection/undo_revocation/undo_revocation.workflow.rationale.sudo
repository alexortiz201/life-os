# weekly_reflection.undo_revocation.workflow.rationale.sudo

PURPOSE:
  Explain rationale for revocation-based undo.

---

# RATIONALE

WHY UNDO MUST BE SEMANTIC:
  Physical deletion affects storage.
  Undo must affect belief and authority.

WHY DOWNSTREAM INVALIDATION IS REQUIRED:
  Downstream artifacts were created under trust assumptions.
  If those assumptions are revoked, outputs must be re-justified or marked unsafe.

WHY UNDO IS NOT ROLLBACK:
  History still happened.
  The system changes what it stands behind going forward.

WHAT SILENTLY BREAKS IF WRONG:
  - dashboards and plans remain trusted and drive behavior
  - agents continue to cite revoked notes as sources
  - future decisions rest on corrupted foundations

🍰 SUPER SIMPLE:
  Trust is the thing you must undo.
  Everything else is just storage.
