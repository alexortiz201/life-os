PURPOSE:
  Explain why partial approval is necessary and how it protects meaning.

---

# RATIONALE

WHY PARTIAL APPROVAL EXISTS:
  Full rejection wastes safe intent.
  Full approval grants too much power.
  Partial approval preserves momentum while preventing authority leaks.

WHY CONSTRAINTS MUST BE EXPLICIT:
  Implicit constraints become loopholes.
  If the system cannot enforce it, it is not a constraint.

WHY PLANNING MUST OBEY CONSTRAINTS:
  Planning is where hidden scope creep sneaks in.
  If planning can widen power, validation is meaningless.

WHY EXECUTION OUTPUTS STAY PROVISIONAL:
  Execution can succeed under assumptions that later change.
  Commit is the moment the system chooses belief.

WHAT SILENTLY BREAKS IF WRONG:
  - broad selectors pull unintended MEMORY, creating misleading notes
  - outputs land in the wrong place, bypassing governance boundaries
  - provisional notes become “truth” without commit, corrupting downstream systems

🍰 SUPER SIMPLE:
  Partial approval is how the system says:
  "I trust your goal,
   not your requested power."
