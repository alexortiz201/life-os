# denied_action.workflow.rationale.sudo

PURPOSE:
  Explain the design rationale for rejecting scope-breaching proposals
  and why the pipeline halts at validation.

# RATIONALE

WHY THIS DENIAL IS IMPORTANT:
  Scope breaches are authority breaches.
  If an agent can write anywhere, it can create meaning anywhere.

WHY VALIDATION MUST CATCH IT:
  If scope checks happen later:
    - execution might already have side effects
    - reversibility becomes expensive or impossible
    - the system teaches agents “try anyway”

WHY OUTPUT_SCOPE IS THE TRIPWIRE:
  TARGET describes what is acted upon (MEMORY).
  OUTPUT_SCOPE describes where new meaning would land.
  Denial here proves:
    the system distinguishes "read scope" from "write scope".

WHY FAIL-CLOSED:
  Under uncertainty, granting power is the worst move.
  Blocking is safer than guessing.

WHAT SILENTLY BREAKS IF WRONG:
  - notes appear in forbidden locations
  - governance files get modified by agents
  - audit becomes untrustworthy because “rejected” actions still changed the world

🍰 SUPER_SIMPLE:
  If you can write where you shouldn’t,
  you can become the system.
