# SYSTEMS

- Validation, planning, execution, and commit solve different problems.
- Execution changes the world; commit changes belief.
- Re validation exists because time invalidates assumptions.
- Pipelines fail safely only when every stage can halt independently.

🍰 SUPER SIMPLE:
Acting is not believing.
Belief must be earned again.

---

# STATE & INVARIANTS

- Meaning becomes more dangerous as it becomes more trusted.
- Every trust boundary requires a fresh check.
- Provisional state is a safety buffer, not an optimization.
- Atomic commit prevents partial truth.

🍰 SUPER SIMPLE:
Truth should be hard to reach.

---

# AGENTS

- Agents never create trusted meaning.
- Agents propose; systems decide.
- Trying anyway is a violation, not persistence.
- Attribution must survive deletion.

🍰 SUPER SIMPLE:
Suggestion is cheap.
Belief is expensive.

---

# EXECUTION PIPELINES

- No stage may assume the next stage will run.
- Re validation protects against fast, silent corruption.
- Commit is irreversible even if artifacts are deleted.
- Auditability is a first class requirement.

🍰 SUPER SIMPLE:
Check.
Try.
Check again.
Then believe.

---

# META

- If re validation feels redundant, you are assuming time is frozen.
- If commit feels obvious, you are underestimating trust.
- Confusion here signals real system boundaries.

🍰 SUPER SIMPLE:
If it’s subtle, it’s important.

STATEMENT: If trust changes, the system must write a record that proves who promoted what, from where, and why.
🍰 SUPER_SIMPLE: If it became “true,” show the receipt.
