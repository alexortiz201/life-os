# Phase 1 — DNA States

PURPOSE:
  Define the allowed states for each core entity.
  States are minimal and correctness-driven.

SCOPE:
  Only defines valid states, not transitions or workflows.
  Transitions belong to RNA.

RULE:
  Add states only when they prevent invalid meaning
  or support downstream workflows.
