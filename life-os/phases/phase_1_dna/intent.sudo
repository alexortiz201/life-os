# Phase 1 — Life-OS DNA (Semantic Genome)

PURPOSE:
  Define the semantic contract of Life-OS:
  what things mean, what is valid, and what must never happen.

GOAL:
  Produce a stable ontology that enables:
    - deterministic pipelines (RNA)
    - safe agent behavior (later)
    - RAG grounding (later)
    - human-facing expression without semantic drift

---

# WHY THIS PHASE EXISTS

Without DNA:
  - pipelines become ad-hoc
  - “memory” and “artifact” lose meaning
  - agents act without clear boundaries
  - RAG retrieval has no grounding target
  - the system becomes hard to explain and harder to evolve

This phase exists to make meaning stable
before introducing behavior.

---

# SCOPE

INCLUDE:
  - core entities (names, intent, relationships)
  - entity identifiers
  - entity states
  - invariants and constraints
  - canonical metadata fields
  - versioning strategy for schema evolution

EXCLUDE:
  - AI prompting and model choices
  - orchestration logic
  - RAG chunking, embeddings, retrieval
  - agent loops and tool usage
  - UI or rendering decisions

DNA contains meaning only.
DNA contains no behavior.

# SUCCESS CRITERIA

Phase 1 is complete WHEN:

  - the core entities are enumerated
    and their relationships are unambiguous

  - every entity has:
      - a stable identifier scheme
      - a minimal state model
      - explicit invariants

  - the ontology supports future work:
      - RNA transformations can be defined
      - agents can be bounded
      - RAG can be grounded to entity meaning

  - the system can be explained coherently
    without referencing implementation

---

# NOTES

Constraint:
  keep the number of core entities small.
  prefer composability over breadth.

Rule:
  if an entity does not support a clear learning goal,
  it does not belong yet.
