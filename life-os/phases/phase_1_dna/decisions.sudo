# Phase 1 — Life-OS DNA (Decisions)

PURPOSE:
  Record the irreversible or high-impact choices
  that define the DNA layer.

SCOPE:
  Applies to Phase 1 and constrains future phases
  unless explicitly revised.

---

# DECISION: DNA_IS_DATA_ONLY

CHOICE:
  DNA is encoded as data and contracts only.

RULE:
  no behavior
  no pipelines
  no prompts
  no orchestration

---

# DECISION: SMALL_CORE_ENTITY_SET

CHOICE:
  Keep the core entity set minimal (target 10–15).

RULE:
  prefer adding metadata to existing entities
  over adding new entity types.

---

# DECISION: IDENTIFIERS_ARE_STABLE

CHOICE:
  Every entity has a stable, unique identifier.

RULE:
  identifiers do not encode mutable meaning
  identifiers do not change across state transitions

---

# DECISION: INVARIANTS_ARE_FIRST_CLASS

CHOICE:
  Invariants are explicitly defined and versioned.

RULE:
  if an invariant cannot be expressed clearly,
  the entity design is incomplete.

---

# DECISION: STATE_MODELS_ARE_MINIMAL

CHOICE:
  State machines are minimal and correctness-driven.

RULE:
  add states only when they prevent invalid meaning
  or support downstream workflows

---

# DECISION: SCHEMA_EVOLUTION_IS_EXPLICIT

CHOICE:
  DNA supports evolution through versioned schema changes.

RULE:
  changes are additive when possible
  breaking changes require migration notes

---

# DECISION: RAG_AND_AGENTS_ATTACH_TO_DNA_LATER

CHOICE:
  RAG and agent behavior are downstream capabilities,
  not part of DNA.

RULE:
  DNA defines what can be grounded to
  and what actions are allowed,
  but not how those actions are executed.

---

# REVISION_POLICY

MAY_REVISE decisions ONLY IF:
  - the ontology cannot support required workflows
  - a core invariant becomes unworkable
  - real usage reveals missing semantics

ALL revisions MUST:
  - name the original decision
  - state why it failed
  - record the new constraint
