# Phase 1 Learnings — DNA Foundations

PURPOSE:
  Capture what became clear while defining Life-OS DNA.
  Record decisions, non-decisions, and constraints
  before behavior (RNA) or UI (Expression).

SCOPE:
  Phase 1 only.
  Ontology, states, and invariants.
  No execution logic.

# WHAT WORKED

ENTITY_FIRST_MODELING:
  Defining entities before workflows
  prevented premature solutioning.

INVARIANTS_OVER_FEATURES:
  Asking "what must never be violated"
  clarified system boundaries faster than adding features.

SEPARATION_OF_CONCERNS:
  Explicit DNA vs RNA vs Expression
  reduced ambiguity about where logic belongs.

AGENT_AS_CONSTRAINED_ACTOR:
  Treating agents as permissioned actors
  avoided unsafe automation assumptions early.

# KEY_DECISIONS

CATEGORIES_AS_TOP_LEVEL_AXIS:
  Categories exist above visions.
  Visions align to categories, not replace them.

VISION_FLEXIBILITY:
  Visions may span multiple categories.
  Categories do not enforce exclusivity.

MINIMAL_CORE_ENTITIES:
  XP, schedules, notifications, and themes
  are derived or metadata, not core entities.

MEMORY_NOTE_ARTIFACT_CHAIN:
  MEMORY = raw input
  NOTE = human synthesis
  ARTIFACT = stable output
  This progression anchors all learning and output.

PHASE_AS_TRUTH_ENFORCER:
  Phases exist to force synthesis.
  Completion requires intent, decisions, and learnings.

# WHAT_WAS_EXPLICITLY_DEFERRED

NO_EXECUTION_LOGIC:
  No workflows, agents, or transforms in DNA.

NO_STORAGE_DECISIONS:
  No databases, schemas, or persistence models.

NO_UI_ASSUMPTIONS:
  No dashboards, layouts, or interaction models.

NO_RAG_ASSUMPTIONS:
  Retrieval, embeddings, and grounding
  belong to RNA and later phases.

NO_AUTOMATION_PROMISES:
  Agents may propose actions,
  not commit changes without user approval.

---

# CONSTRAINTS_DISCOVERED

SAFE_AGENT_ACTIONS_REQUIRE:
  - clear ownership
  - explicit permissions
  - full attribution
  - invariant preservation

PROGRESS_MUST_BE_EVIDENCED:
  DONE states imply artifacts or notes exist.
  No silent completion.

SYSTEM_HONESTY_DEPENDS_ON:
  provenance tracking
  explicit state transitions
  immutable history for artifacts

# MENTAL_MODEL_LOCKED_IN

THINK_IN_THIS_ORDER:
  1. Entity
  2. Ownership
  3. State
  4. Invariant
  5. Allowed transition

AVOID_THIS_ORDER:
  1. Feature
  2. UI
  3. Automation
  4. Fix invariants later

# READINESS_CHECK

PHASE_1_IS_COMPLETE_WHEN:
  - entities are defined
  - states are explicit
  - invariants are enforceable
  - no behavior is assumed

STATUS:
  READY_TO_MOVE_TO_RNA
