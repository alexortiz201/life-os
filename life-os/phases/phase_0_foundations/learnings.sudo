# Phase 0 — Learnings

PURPOSE:
  Capture what is now understood
  as a direct result of completing Phase 0.

SCOPE:
  These learnings inform all future phases.
  They are not hypothetical.

---

# LEARNING: INTENT MUST PRECEDE IMPLEMENTATION

OBSERVATION:
  Without explicit intent,
  systems drift toward convenience and habit.

INSIGHT:
  Writing intent first
  reduces accidental complexity later.

IMPACT:
  Design decisions are easier to justify
  and easier to revisit.

---

# LEARNING: STRUCTURE REDUCES COGNITIVE LOAD

OBSERVATION:
  Ambiguous structure forces constant re-orientation.

INSIGHT:
  Phases, files, and contracts
  allow work to resume after interruptions.

IMPACT:
  Progress becomes possible in short sessions
  without losing coherence.

---

# LEARNING: LEARNING ITSELF NEEDS CONSTRAINTS

OBSERVATION:
  “Learning everything” leads to shallow coverage.

INSIGHT:
  Forcing each concept to earn its place
  increases depth and retention.

IMPACT:
  Fewer concepts are introduced,
  but each one compounds.

---

# LEARNING: DOCUMENTATION CAN BE AN EXECUTABLE ARTIFACT

OBSERVATION:
  Free-form notes decay quickly.

INSIGHT:
  Structured language (Sudolang)
  preserves intent without premature code.

IMPACT:
  Decisions remain inspectable
  and can be reasoned about later.

---

# LEARNING: SNAPSHOTS ENABLE TRUST

OBSERVATION:
  Systems without stable reference points
  are hard to reason about historically.

INSIGHT:
  Immutable snapshots preserve understanding,
  not just code.

IMPACT:
  Past states become assets,
  not liabilities.

---

# LEARNING: FOUNDATIONS ARE A FORCE MULTIPLIER

OBSERVATION:
  Skipping foundations feels fast
  but creates downstream friction.

INSIGHT:
  Time spent clarifying foundations
  pays back repeatedly.

IMPACT:
  Future phases start clearer
  and require fewer corrections.

---

# SUMMARY

After Phase 0:
  - intent is explicit
  - constraints are enforceable
  - structure is predictable
  - learning is deliberate

This phase changed HOW the system will be built,
not WHAT the system does.
