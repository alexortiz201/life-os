# Phase 0 — Decisions

PURPOSE:
  Record irreversible decisions that define
  how Life-OS will be built and evolved.

SCOPE:
  Decisions in this file apply to all future phases
  unless explicitly revised.

---

# DECISION: LEARNING-FIRST DEVELOPMENT

CHOICE:
  Optimize Life-OS for learning signal,
  not speed, features, or polish.

RATIONALE:
  Shallow progress compounds confusion.
  Deep understanding compounds capability.

IMPLICATIONS:
  - slower visible progress
  - more documentation
  - fewer shortcuts
  - higher long-term leverage

---

# DECISION: PHASED, SELF-CONTAINED STRUCTURE

CHOICE:
  Develop Life-OS in explicit, standalone phases.

RATIONALE:
  Phases reduce cognitive load
  and preserve context across time gaps.

IMPLICATIONS:
  - each phase must stand alone
  - future phases cannot assume prior knowledge
  - synthesis is deferred, not implicit

---

# DECISION: SUDOLANG AS SYSTEM CONTRACT

CHOICE:
  Use Sudolang for intent, constraints, and decisions.

RATIONALE:
  Natural language is ambiguous.
  Code is premature.
  Sudolang enforces structure without over-specification.

IMPLICATIONS:
  - all intent files are machine-readable
  - structure is explicit
  - documentation becomes executable reasoning

---

# DECISION: SNAPSHOT-BASED EVOLUTION

CHOICE:
  Preserve system state via immutable snapshots.

MECHANISM:
  - Git tags per completed phase
  - no history rewriting

RATIONALE:
  Understanding requires stable reference points.

IMPLICATIONS:
  - past decisions remain inspectable
  - regressions are explainable
  - learning milestones are auditable

---

# DECISION: EXPLICIT TRADEOFF RECORDING

CHOICE:
  Record tradeoffs at the time they are made.

RATIONALE:
  Forgotten tradeoffs become hidden constraints.

IMPLICATIONS:
  - decisions files grow slowly
  - ambiguity is reduced
  - future refactors have context

---

# DECISION: SYSTEMS OVER FEATURES

CHOICE:
  Prioritize system structure over user-facing features.

RATIONALE:
  Features change.
  Systems persist.

IMPLICATIONS:
  - early output may appear minimal
  - learning value remains high
  - refactors are cheaper

---

# DECISION: NO PREMATURE ABSTRACTION

CHOICE:
  Avoid abstractions until the underlying problem
  is fully understood.

RATIONALE:
  Abstractions hide ignorance.

IMPLICATIONS:
  - more verbose early designs
  - clearer failure modes
  - better intuition later

---

# REVISION POLICY

DECISIONS MAY be revisited ONLY IF:
  - new constraints emerge
  - learning objectives change
  - evidence contradicts assumptions

ALL revisions MUST:
  - be documented explicitly
  - include rationale
  - reference original decision
