# Phase 0 — Foundations

PURPOSE:
  Establish the intellectual and structural foundation
  for Life-OS before any irreversible implementation begins.

GOAL:
  Reset assumptions.
  Lock intent.
  Define constraints.
  Create a stable base for all future phases.

---

# WHY THIS PHASE EXISTS

Life-OS is a long-lived system.
Early ambiguity compounds if not addressed explicitly.

This phase exists to:
  - clarify intent before action
  - prevent accidental scope creep
  - align learning goals with system design
  - reduce cognitive load in later phases

No code written here should be considered permanent.

---

# PRIMARY QUESTIONS

This phase answers:

  - What problem is Life-OS actually solving?
  - What kind of learning is this system meant to produce?
  - What tradeoffs are explicitly accepted?
  - What constraints are non-negotiable?

Any question not answered here
is deferred intentionally.

---

# CONSTRAINTS ESTABLISHED

ASSUME:
  - learning is the primary output
  - correctness matters more than speed
  - understanding precedes optimization

REQUIRE:
  - explicit intent before implementation
  - visible tradeoffs
  - inspectable system boundaries

PROHIBIT:
  - feature-driven development
  - hiding complexity behind abstractions
  - premature optimization
  - building without a learning objective

---

# SCOPE OF WORK

INCLUDE:
  - defining how phases are structured
  - defining what constitutes progress
  - defining how decisions are documented
  - defining how learning is preserved

EXCLUDE:
  - implementation details
  - performance optimization
  - tooling choices unless unavoidable

---

# SUCCESS CRITERIA

This phase is complete WHEN:

  - Life-OS can be explained clearly
    without referencing code

  - future phases can be added
    without redefining intent

  - learning goals are explicit
    and enforceable

  - decisions made later
    can be traced back to this foundation

---

# OUTPUTS

EXPECTED ARTIFACTS:
  - clear intent files per phase
  - consistent Sudolang structure
  - shared mental model for future work

These artifacts are treated as contracts,
not suggestions.

---

# FINAL NOTE

This phase optimizes for:
  clarity over momentum
  alignment over activity
  foundations over features

Every future phase assumes
this work was done correctly.
