# RE VALIDATION CONTRACT — EDUCATION

PURPOSE:
  Teach why systems must re check assumptions
  after acting but before believing.

---

# CACHE WARM

WHAT_LAYER:
  RNA

UNIVERSAL_PROBLEM:
  Time and context invalidate assumptions.

RECALL_HOOKS:
  MNEMONICS:
    - "Acted ≠ Allowed"
    - "Then was not now"
    - "Check before belief"

  INVARIANT_REMINDERS:
    - Execution is provisional
    - Context outranks history
    - Trust must be earned twice

  QUESTIONS:
    - What changed while we were acting?
    - Are permissions still valid?
    - Does this still mean what we think it means?

CONTEXT_SPECIFICITY:
  SYSTEMS
  AGENTS
  AI INTEGRATION

FAILURE_MODE:
  Stale assumptions becoming truth
  Authority granted after revocation
  Silent invariant violation

# MENTAL MODEL

MODEL:
  Re Validation is a second lock on the door.

ANALOGY:
  Checking credentials again before boarding.
  Re checking account balance before transfer.
  Verifying state before committing a transaction.

---

# WHY RE VALIDATION EXISTS

INSIGHT:
  Computers act faster than humans,
  but slower than meaning can change.

CONCLUSION:
  Acting safely requires checking twice.

---

# COMMON MISUNDERSTANDINGS

MISCONCEPTION:
  "Initial validation was enough."

CORRECTION:
  Validation answers a past question.

MISCONCEPTION:
  "Nothing changed during execution."

CORRECTION:
  You cannot assume that.

MISCONCEPTION:
  "Re validation is redundant."

CORRECTION:
  Redundancy is protection, not waste.

# FAILURE PATTERNS

PATTERN:
  Skipping re validation for speed.

RESULT:
  Permanent belief based on outdated rules.

PATTERN:
  Partial re validation.

RESULT:
  Invariants erode selectively.
