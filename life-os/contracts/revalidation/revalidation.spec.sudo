# RE VALIDATION CONTRACT — SPEC

PURPOSE:
  Define how the system confirms that execution results
  are still justified before meaning becomes trusted.

ROLE:
  Re Validation protects against time, drift,
  and stale assumptions between execution and commit.

SCOPE:
  This contract governs ONLY re validation.
  It does NOT define execution or commit behavior.

---

# STAGE DEFINITION

STAGE:
  NAME: RE VALIDATION
  POSITION: Fifth stage in RNA execution pipeline

RULE:
  Re Validation exists because the world can change.

---

# INPUTS

INPUT:
  PROPOSAL_RECORD
  VALIDATION_DECISION
  EXECUTION_PLAN
  EXECUTION_RESULT
  EXECUTION_EFFECTS_LOG
  COMMIT_POLICY

CONTEXT_INPUTS:
  - fresh system state snapshot
  - current permissions
  - current invariants
  - current scopes

RULE:
  Inputs MUST reflect current reality,
  not assumptions from earlier stages.

---

# OUTPUTS

OUTPUT:
  REVALIDATION_DECISION

REVALIDATION_DECISION_MUST_CONTAIN:
  - decision_id
  - decision_type
  - justification
  - constraints (if partial)
  - timestamp
  - referenced invariants
  - actor attribution (system)

OUTCOMES:
  - APPROVE COMMIT
  - REJECT COMMIT
  - PARTIAL COMMIT
  - ESCALATE COMMIT

---

# RESPONSIBILITIES

THIS_STAGE_MUST:
  - re check all relevant invariants
  - re confirm permissions and scope
  - verify execution matches the plan
  - verify effects are still allowable
  - detect meaning drift

THIS_STAGE_MUST_NOT:
  - execute new actions
  - modify execution results
  - escalate trust
  - commit meaning
  - infer intent

RULE:
  Re Validation judges reality, not intent.

---

# FAILURE BEHAVIOR

FAILURE_ALLOWED_ONLY_IF:
  - invariant violation detected
  - permissions revoked or changed
  - scope invalidated
  - mismatch between plan and execution
  - critical context drift

FAILURE_MODE:
  FAIL CLOSED

FAILURE_MEANS:
  - commit is blocked
  - execution results remain provisional
  - no belief is created

---

# STAGE INVARIANTS

INVARIANT_1:
  No commit without re validation.

INVARIANT_2:
  Re Validation is pure and side effect free.

INVARIANT_3:
  Context is authoritative over past assumptions.

---

# TRUST MODEL

TRUST_LEVEL:
  UNTRUSTED

RULE:
  Passing execution does not imply commit eligibility.

---

# HANDOFF CONTRACT

HANDOFF_TO:
  COMMIT STAGE

HANDOFF_GUARANTEES:
  - decision is explicit
  - justification is recorded
  - constraints are unambiguous

RULE:
  Commit may not reinterpret re validation.

---

# ONE LINE SPINE

STATEMENT:
  "Re Validation asks whether execution
   still deserves to become truth."

---

# SUPER SIMPLE

SUMMARY:
  Check again.
  Reality might have changed.
