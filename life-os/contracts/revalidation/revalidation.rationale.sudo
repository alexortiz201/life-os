# RE VALIDATION CONTRACT — RATIONALE

PURPOSE:
  Explain why re validation is non negotiable
  in any system that cares about truth.

---

# DESIGN COMMITMENTS

COMMITMENT_1:
  Re Validation always runs before commit.

RATIONALE:
  Commit is irreversible at the meaning level.

---

COMMITMENT_2:
  Re Validation uses fresh context.

RATIONALE:
  Cached assumptions are lies waiting to happen.

---

COMMITMENT_3:
  Re Validation can block commit even after success.

RATIONALE:
  Success does not override safety.

---

# REJECTED ALTERNATIVES

REJECTED:
  "Trust initial validation"

REASON:
  Ignores time and drift.

---

REJECTED:
  "Auto commit on execution success"

REASON:
  Collapses action and belief.

---

# SYSTEM CONSEQUENCES

WITHOUT RE VALIDATION:
  Systems encode outdated reality as truth.

WITH RE VALIDATION:
  Systems remain honest under change.

---

# FINAL ASSERTION

STATEMENT:
  Re Validation exists because
  time breaks assumptions.
