# ARTIFACTS — V1

PURPOSE:
  List the available artifact types referenced by system contracts.
  This file is the short index of “what can exist”.

RULE:
  This file lists availability only.
  Definitions live in `artifacts_catalog.v1.spec.sudo`.

---

ARTIFACT_TYPES:
  - NOTE
  - REPORT
  - JOURNAL_ENTRY
  - ANALYSIS_REPORT
  - TEACHING_PLAN
  - FUNDAMENTAL
  - AUDIT_LOG
  - EXECUTION_EFFECTS_LOG
  - COMMIT_RECORD

---

PIPELINE_CRITICAL:
  PURPOSE:
    Artifacts required for safe RNA pipeline operation and auditability.

  TYPES:
    - PROPOSAL_RECORD
    - VALIDATION_DECISION
    - EXECUTION_PLAN
    - EXECUTION_EFFECTS_LOG
    - COMMIT_RECORD
    - AUDIT_LOG

RULE:
  If a PIPELINE_CRITICAL artifact is missing,
  the pipeline must halt fail-closed.

---

USER_FACING:
  PURPOSE:
    Artifacts intended to be read by humans as primary interaction surfaces.

  TYPES:
    - NOTE
    - JOURNAL_ENTRY
    - REPORT
    - TEACHING_PLAN
    - FUNDAMENTAL

RULE:
  USER_FACING does not imply trust.
  Trust is defined by artifact class rules and promotion records.

---

AGENT_FACING:
  PURPOSE:
    Artifacts intended to be consumed by agents for reasoning, governance, or execution.

  TYPES:
    - ANALYSIS_REPORT
    - AUDIT_LOG
    - EXECUTION_EFFECTS_LOG
    - COMMIT_RECORD

RULE:
  AGENT_FACING artifacts may inform proposals,
  but cannot justify trust escalation without validation and commit.

---

DERIVATION_HINTS:
  PURPOSE:
    Lightweight map of which artifacts commonly derive from others.
    This is NOT a permission map.

  COMMON_DERIVATIONS:
    NOTE:

      FROM:
        - TEACHING_PLAN
        - WORKFLOW_PAPER_RUNS
        - LEARNINGS

RULE:
  A derivation hint is not provenance.
  Provenance must be recorded explicitly per artifact definition.
