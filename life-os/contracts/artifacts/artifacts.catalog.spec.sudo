# ARTIFACTS CATALOG — V1 SPEC

PURPOSE:
  Define canonical artifact classes, trust levels, and promotion rules.
  Prevent silent authority escalation by making downstream use depend on artifact class.

SCOPE:
  This file defines:
    - TRUST LEVELS
    - ARTIFACT CLASS definitions (semantics + required fields + forbidden uses)
    - PROMOTION RULES
    - UNIVERSAL SAFETY INVARIANTS

  This file does NOT define:
    - storage locations
    - UI rendering
    - TypeScript schemas
    - implementation details

# CORE PRINCIPLES

RULE:
  A produced object is not trusted meaning by default.

RULE:
  Trust increases only at explicit trust boundaries.

RULE:
  Artifact class determines allowed downstream use.

---

# TRUST LEVELS

TRUST LEVELS:
  UNTRUSTED:
    DESCRIPTION:
      Raw capture or transport.
      No semantic claims allowed.
    ALLOWED_ACTIONS:
      - store
      - route
      - reference as input
    FORBIDDEN_ACTIONS:
      - drive execution
      - justify authority

  PROVISIONAL:
    DESCRIPTION:
      Interpreted meaning.
      Must include provenance and uncertainty markers when interpretive.
    ALLOWED_ACTIONS:
      - inform planning
      - propose next steps
      - be reviewed for promotion
    FORBIDDEN_ACTIONS:
      - act without validation
      - be treated as system belief

  COMMITTED:
    DESCRIPTION:
      System-backed meaning.
      Allowed to drive downstream action without re-verification.
    ALLOWED_ACTIONS:
      - authorize downstream behavior per contracts
      - be used as stable system state
    FORBIDDEN_ACTIONS:
      - silent downgrade without revocation record

  DERIVED:
    DESCRIPTION:
      Computed from COMMITTED meaning.
      Must link to sources and derivation rules.
    ALLOWED_ACTIONS:
      - accelerate reads and summaries
      - power UI views
    FORBIDDEN_ACTIONS:
      - override committed meaning
      - hide source lineage

RULE:
  Most agent outputs are PROVISIONAL unless produced by COMMIT
  or explicitly accepted via a promotion rule.

# PROMOTION RULES

RULE:
  Only COMMIT stage promotes pipeline outputs to COMMITTED meaning.

RULE:
  Non-pipeline artifacts (reports, plans, analyses) require:
    - explicit user acceptance OR
    - governance-approved promotion path

RULE:
  No artifact may change trust level without an explicit promotion record.

---

# UNIVERSAL SAFETY INVARIANTS

INVARIANT:
  Artifact class determines allowed downstream actions.

INVARIANT:
  No PROVISIONAL artifact may be treated as COMMITTED.

INVARIANT:
  Every artifact must be attributable and linkable to sources.

INVARIANT:
  Deleting files does not revoke committed meaning without revocation records.
