# COMMIT CONTRACT — RATIONALE

PURPOSE:
  Explain why commit is isolated,
  irreversible, and system owned.

---

# DESIGN COMMITMENTS

COMMITMENT_1:
  Only the system commits.

RATIONALE:
  Allowing agents to commit is silent authority.

---

COMMITMENT_2:
  Commit is atomic.

RATIONALE:
  Partial belief is incoherent.

---

COMMITMENT_3:
  Commit is irreversible.

RATIONALE:
  Belief must not oscillate.

---

# REJECTED ALTERNATIVES

REJECTED:
  "Soft commit"

REASON:
  Creates ambiguous truth.

---

REJECTED:
  "Agent driven commit"

REASON:
  Breaks authority boundaries.

---

# SYSTEM CONSEQUENCES

WITHOUT COMMIT:
  The system cannot know what is true.

WITH COMMIT:
  The system becomes coherent and reliable.

---

# FINAL ASSERTION

STATEMENT:
  Commit is where responsibility becomes real.
