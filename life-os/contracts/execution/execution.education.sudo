PURPOSE:
  Teach how systems can act powerfully
  without accidentally lying to themselves.

# CACHE WARM

WHAT_LAYER:
  RNA

UNIVERSAL_PROBLEM:
  Preventing action from becoming belief.

RECALL_HOOKS:
  MNEMONICS:
    - "Act ≠ Believe"
    - "Effects before truth"
    - "Nothing counts yet"

  INVARIANT_REMINDERS:
    - Execution is provisional
    - Logs are mandatory
    - Trust happens later

  QUESTIONS:
    - What if this fails halfway?
    - What if meaning changes mid-run?
    - Can this be safely discarded?

CONTEXT_SPECIFICITY:
  SYSTEMS
  AGENTS
  AI INTEGRATION

FAILURE_MODE:
  Silent authority escalation
  Belief created by side effects
  Irreversible partial truth

# MENTAL MODEL

MODEL:
  Execution is a dry run with consequences.

EXPLANATION:
  Execution touches reality
  but does not update the system’s understanding of reality.

ANALOGY:
  A transaction before commit.
  A deployment before promotion.
  A trial before verdict.

# WHY EXECUTION IS DANGEROUS

REASON:
  Execution changes the world.

INSIGHT:
  World changes are harder to undo than beliefs.

CONCLUSION:
  Belief must lag behind action.

# COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS

MISCONCEPTION:
  "If execution succeeded, it must be true."

CORRECTION:
  Success does not equal permission.

MISCONCEPTION:
  "Execution can fix mistakes dynamically."

CORRECTION:
  Execution must stop, not improvise.

MISCONCEPTION:
  "Logging is optional."

CORRECTION:
  Unlogged effects are silent corruption.

# FAILURE PATTERNS TO WATCH FOR

PATTERN:
  Execution retries silently.

RESULT:
  Duplicate or compounding effects.

PATTERN:
  Execution suppresses partial failure.

RESULT:
  System believes a lie later.

PATTERN:
  Execution adapts to context drift.

RESULT:
  Invariants erode invisibly.
