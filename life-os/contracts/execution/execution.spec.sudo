# EXECUTION CONTRACT — SPEC

PURPOSE:
  Define how an approved and planned action
  produces real effects without creating trusted meaning.

ROLE:
  Execution performs effects provisionally,
  without belief, authority escalation, or commitment.

SCOPE:
  This contract governs ONLY execution.
  It does NOT define validation, planning, re-validation, or commit behavior.

---

# STAGE DEFINITION

STAGE:
  NAME: EXECUTION
  POSITION: Fourth stage in RNA execution pipeline

RULE:
  Execution may change the world.
  Execution must not change belief.

---

# INPUTS

INPUT:
  PROPOSAL_RECORD
  VALIDATION_DECISION
  EXECUTION_PLAN

CONTEXT_INPUTS:
  - runtime system state
  - dependency availability
  - scope enforcement context

RULE:
  Execution MUST follow the execution plan exactly.
  No inference, expansion, or reinterpretation is allowed.

---

# OUTPUTS

OUTPUT:
  EXECUTION_RESULT
  EXECUTION_EFFECTS_LOG

EXECUTION_RESULT_MUST_CONTAIN:
  - execution_id
  - plan_id reference
  - success / failure status
  - encountered errors
  - runtime timestamps
  - actor attribution

EXECUTION_EFFECTS_LOG_MUST_CONTAIN:
  - ordered list of effects
  - effect type
  - affected entities
  - scope boundaries
  - provisional artifacts created
  - checksums / fingerprints where applicable

RULE:
  Every effect MUST be recorded.
  No silent effects are allowed.

---

# RESPONSIBILITIES

THIS_STAGE_MUST:
  - execute steps exactly as planned
  - enforce scope boundaries at runtime
  - halt on invariant violation
  - log every effect before completion
  - treat all outputs as provisional

THIS_STAGE_MUST_NOT:
  - validate permissions
  - re-plan steps
  - infer missing intent
  - escalate trust
  - commit meaning
  - suppress failures
  - “try anyway”

RULE:
  Execution is mechanical, not interpretive.

---

# FAILURE BEHAVIOR

FAILURE_ALLOWED_ONLY_IF:
  - invariant violation occurs
  - runtime dependency is unavailable
  - scope boundary is breached
  - execution step fails

FAILURE_MODE:
  FAIL_FAST

FAILURE_MEANS:
  - execution halts immediately
  - partial effects remain provisional
  - failure is fully logged
  - no commit may occur

RULE:
  Partial execution is safer than silent completion.

---

# STAGE INVARIANTS

INVARIANT_1:
  Execution produces no trusted meaning.

INVARIANT_2:
  Execution effects are fully logged.

INVARIANT_3:
  Execution cannot exceed planned scope.

INVARIANT_4:
  Execution must be haltable at any step.

---

# TRUST MODEL

TRUST_LEVEL:
  PROVISIONAL

RULE:
  Execution outputs are untrusted
  until explicitly committed.

---

# HANDOFF CONTRACT

HANDOFF_TO:
  RE-VALIDATION_STAGE

HANDOFF_GUARANTEES:
  - complete effects log exists
  - execution outcome is explicit
  - no belief has been created

RULE:
  Re-validation judges execution in context.
  Execution must not anticipate commitment.

---

# ONE LINE SPINE

STATEMENT:
  "Execution makes things happen,
   without deciding what they mean."

---

# SUPER SIMPLE

SUMMARY:
  Do the work.
  Log everything.
  Believe nothing.
