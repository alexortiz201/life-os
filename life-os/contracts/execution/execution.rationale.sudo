# EXECUTION CONTRACT — RATIONALE

PURPOSE:
  Capture why execution is strictly separated
  from belief, validation, and commit.

---

# DESIGN COMMITMENTS

COMMITMENT_1:
  Execution never escalates trust.

RATIONALE:
  Trust escalation is irreversible.
  Execution must remain discardable.

---

COMMITMENT_2:
  Execution is bound to a plan.

RATIONALE:
  Free-form execution is hidden authority.

---

COMMITMENT_3:
  Execution logs everything.

RATIONALE:
  Without logs, failures become unknowable.

---

COMMITMENT_4:
  Execution halts on violation.

RATIONALE:
  Continuing under violation compounds damage.

---

# REJECTED ALTERNATIVES

REJECTED:
  "Auto-commit on success"

REASON:
  Creates belief without re-validation.

---

REJECTED:
  "Execution-driven validation"

REASON:
  Makes effects justify permission.

---

REJECTED:
  "Best-effort execution"

REASON:
  Partial truth is worse than failure.

---

# SYSTEM CONSEQUENCES

IF EXECUTION CREATES BELIEF:
  The system lies to itself.

IF EXECUTION IS UNLOGGED:
  Errors cannot be reasoned about.

IF EXECUTION IS STRICT:
  Failures remain containable.

---

# LONG-TERM PAYOFF

BENEFIT:
  Safe retries.

BENEFIT:
  Clear rollback boundaries.

BENEFIT:
  Strong auditability.

BENEFIT:
  Reliable agent participation.

---

# FINAL ASSERTION

STATEMENT:
  Execution exists to act,
  not to decide what is true.
