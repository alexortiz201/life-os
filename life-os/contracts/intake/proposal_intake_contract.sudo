# PROPOSAL INTAKE CONTRACT

PURPOSE:
  Define the first and safest boundary where intent
  enters the Life-OS execution system.

ROLE:
  Convert raw intent into a stable, immutable proposal record
  without granting authority, meaning, or side effects.

SCOPE:
  This contract governs ONLY proposal intake.
  It does NOT define validation, execution, or commit behavior.

# CACHE WARM

WHAT_LAYER:
  RNA

UNIVERSAL_PROBLEM:
  Accepting intent safely without accidentally granting power.

RECALL_HOOKS:
  MNEMONICS:
    - "Intake ≠ Decide"
    - "Record, don’t reason"
    - "Shape before safety"

  INVARIANT_REMINDERS:
    - No side effects before validation
    - No authority before commit
    - Nothing trusted by accident

  QUESTIONS:
    - What guarantees must exist before validation can run?
    - What breaks if intake tries to be helpful?
    - Can this stage be replayed safely?

CONTEXT_SPECIFICITY:
  SYSTEMS
  AGENTS
  AI_INTEGRATION

FAILURE_MODE:
  Silent authority escalation
  Irreversible meaning creation
  Corrupted downstream validation

# STAGE DEFINITION

STAGE:
  NAME: INTAKE
  POSITION: First stage in RNA execution pipeline

RULE:
  Proposal Intake is a gate, not a judge.

---

# INPUTS

INPUT:
  RAW_PROPOSAL:
    - INTENT
    - ACTOR
    - TARGET_ENTITY
    - TARGET_SELECTOR (optional)
    - TARGET_SCOPE
    - DEPENDENCIES
    - IMPACT
    - REVERSIBILITY_CLAIM

  CONTEXT_INPUTS:
    - referenced MEMORY (read-only)
    - system timestamp
    - actor identity metadata

RULE:
  Inputs may be malformed, unsafe, or unjustified.
  This stage does not reject on semantic grounds.

---

# OUTPUTS

OUTPUT:
  PROPOSAL_RECORD

PROPOSAL_RECORD_MUST_CONTAIN:
  - proposal_id (stable, unique)
  - normalized_fields
  - canonical_field_ordering
  - fingerprint (hash or checksum)
  - actor_attribution
  - intake_timestamp
  - preserved_raw_payload

GUARANTEE:
  Identical inputs MUST produce identical fingerprints.

---

# RESPONSIBILITIES

THIS_STAGE_MUST:
  - normalize proposal structure
  - assign a stable identifier
  - compute a fingerprint
  - preserve raw intent verbatim
  - enforce immutability after creation

THIS_STAGE_MUST_NOT:
  - validate permissions
  - evaluate invariants
  - infer intent
  - generate execution plans
  - create artifacts
  - mutate system state
  - escalate or block proposals

RULE:
  Proposal Intake prepares proposals for validation.
  It must never decide if they are allowed.

---

# FAILURE BEHAVIOR

FAILURE_ALLOWED_ONLY_IF:
  - proposal cannot be structurally normalized
  - required fields are missing
  - fingerprint computation fails

FAILURE_MODE:
  HARD_STOP

FAILURE_MEANS:
  No proposal enters the system.
  No downstream stage may run.

RULE:
  Structural failure is safer than semantic guessing.

---

# STAGE INVARIANTS

INVARIANT_1:
  No side effects occur during intake.

INVARIANT_2:
  Intake is deterministic and replayable.

INVARIANT_3:
  No authority is granted or implied.

INVARIANT_4:
  Intake must never "try anyway".

---

# TRUST MODEL

TRUST_LEVEL:
  UNTRUSTED

RULE:
  A well-formed proposal is not a valid proposal.

---

# AUDITABILITY

AUDIT_REQUIREMENT:
  The system MUST be able to answer:
    - Who proposed this?
    - Exactly what was proposed?
    - What context existed at intake time?

RULE:
  Attribution must survive deletion of downstream artifacts.

---

# HANDOFF CONTRACT

HANDOFF_TO:
  VALIDATION_STAGE

HANDOFF_GUARANTEES:
  - proposal shape is stable
  - fingerprint is immutable
  - validation may reason about meaning safely

RULE:
  Validation may reject.
  Intake must never pre-reject.

---

# ONE LINE SPINE

STATEMENT:
  "Proposal Intake turns raw intent into a stable fact,
   without deciding what it means."

---

# SUPER SIMPLE

SUMMARY:
  Write it down.
  Lock it.
  Don't judge it.
