# VALIDATION CONTRACT — RATIONALE

PURPOSE:
  Record why validation is designed as a pure,
  non-executing decision stage.

---

# DESIGN COMMITMENTS

COMMITMENT_1:
  Validation must not mutate state.

RATIONALE:
  Side effects before commitment
  create irreversible authority escalation.

---

COMMITMENT_2:
  Validation produces explicit decision artifacts.

RATIONALE:
  Decisions without records
  cannot be audited, explained, or revoked.

---

COMMITMENT_3:
  Validation is separated from planning.

RATIONALE:
  Planning introduces optimization pressure
  that biases judgment.

---

COMMITMENT_4:
  Validation is time-bound and re-checkable.

RATIONALE:
  System meaning may change
  between validation and commit.

---

# REJECTED ALTERNATIVES

REJECTED:
  "Inline validation during execution"

REASON:
  Execution failure becomes indistinguishable
  from invalid intent.

---

REJECTED:
  "Validation that auto-corrects proposals"

REASON:
  Guessing intent creates meaning
  the actor never claimed.

---

REJECTED:
  "Validation that implies trust"

REASON:
  Trust escalation must be explicit
  and reversible.

---

# SYSTEM CONSEQUENCES

IF VALIDATION IS TOO WEAK:
  Unsafe actions reach execution.

IF VALIDATION IS TOO STRONG:
  System becomes brittle and unusable.

DESIGN BALANCE:
  Validation blocks unsafe attempts
  without deciding outcomes.

---

# LONG-TERM PAYOFF

BENEFIT:
  Clear separation of concerns.

BENEFIT:
  Easier auditing and debugging.

BENEFIT:
  Safe agent participation.

BENEFIT:
  Trust boundaries remain explicit.

---

# FINAL ASSERTION

STATEMENT:
  Validation exists to protect meaning,
  not to make progress.
