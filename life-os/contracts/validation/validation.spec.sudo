# VALIDATION CONTRACT — SPEC

PURPOSE:
  Define how the system determines whether a proposal
  is allowed to proceed toward execution.

ROLE:
  Validation evaluates meaning, authority, scope, and invariants
  without producing side effects or trusted outcomes.

SCOPE:
  This contract governs ONLY validation.
  It does NOT define planning, execution, or commit behavior.

---

# STAGE DEFINITION

STAGE:
  NAME: VALIDATION
  POSITION: Second stage in RNA execution pipeline

RULE:
  Validation is judgment without action.

---

# INPUTS

INPUT:
  PROPOSAL_RECORD

CONTEXT_INPUTS:
  - current system state snapshot
  - applicable invariants
  - actor permissions
  - trust policies
  - scope boundaries

RULE:
  Inputs are treated as authoritative snapshots.
  Validation must not assume stability beyond this stage.

---

# OUTPUTS

OUTPUT:
  VALIDATION_DECISION

VALIDATION_DECISION_MUST_CONTAIN:
  - decision_type
  - decision_constraints (if partial)
  - evaluated invariants
  - scope evaluation
  - justification record
  - attribution metadata
  - decision_timestamp

DECISION_TYPES:
  - APPROVE
  - REJECT
  - PARTIAL_APPROVE
  - ESCALATE

---

# RESPONSIBILITIES

THIS_STAGE_MUST:
  - evaluate proposal against invariants
  - verify actor authority
  - enforce scope boundaries
  - check dependency availability
  - record justification for decision
  - produce an explicit decision artifact

THIS_STAGE_MUST_NOT:
  - mutate system state
  - generate execution plans
  - perform execution
  - create artifacts
  - escalate trust
  - infer missing intent
  - "try anyway"

RULE:
  Validation answers whether an action is allowed,
  not how it will be performed.

---

# FAILURE BEHAVIOR

FAILURE_ALLOWED_ONLY_IF:
  - invariant evaluation fails unexpectedly
  - required context is unavailable
  - justification cannot be produced

FAILURE_MODE:
  FAIL_CLOSED

FAILURE_MEANS:
  - proposal does not advance
  - no downstream stages may run

---

# STAGE INVARIANTS

INVARIANT_1:
  Validation produces no side effects.

INVARIANT_2:
  Validation decisions are fully attributable and explainable.

INVARIANT_3:
  Validation cannot grant trust or authority.

INVARIANT_4:
  Validation logic must be deterministic for identical inputs.

---

# TRUST MODEL

TRUST_LEVEL:
  UNTRUSTED

RULE:
  Approval does not imply truth.
  Approval only implies permission to attempt execution.

---

# HANDOFF CONTRACT

HANDOFF_TO:
  PLANNING_STAGE

HANDOFF_GUARANTEES:
  - explicit decision exists
  - constraints are recorded
  - rejected proposals do not proceed

RULE:
  Downstream stages may rely on the decision,
  but must not assume it remains valid indefinitely.

---

# ONE LINE SPINE

STATEMENT:
  "Validation decides whether an action may be attempted,
   not whether it becomes true."

---

# SUPER SIMPLE

SUMMARY:
  Decide.
  Explain.
  Do nothing else.
