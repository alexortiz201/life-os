# VALIDATION RISK POLICY

PURPOSE:
  Define how validation outcomes are chosen
  based on semantic risk, not convenience.

GOAL:
  Reduce silent authority escalation
  while preserving bounded flexibility.

RULE:
  Validation outcomes must scale power DOWN
  as uncertainty or impact increases.

---

# VALIDATION OUTCOMES

OUTCOMES:
  - APPROVE
  - PARTIAL_APPROVE
  - ESCALATE
  - REJECT

DEFAULT:
  REJECT (fail-closed)

---

# RISK MODEL

RISK is evaluated across three dimensions:
  - IMPACT
  - REVERSIBILITY
  - DEPENDENCIES

RISK_LEVELS:
  - LOW
  - MEDIUM
  - HIGH

RULE:
  Highest detected risk dominates outcome.

---

# IMPACT EVALUATION

IMPACT describes how meaning changes.

LOW_IMPACT:
  - reads MEMORY only
  - creates NOTE without elevating authority
  - no modification of trusted ARTIFACTS

MEDIUM_IMPACT:
  - creates new ARTIFACT
  - modifies existing ARTIFACT content
  - synthesizes trusted meaning from raw inputs

HIGH_IMPACT:
  - modifies permissions or scope
  - replaces or supersedes existing ARTIFACT
  - affects downstream decision pipelines

---

# REVERSIBILITY EVALUATION

REVERSIBILITY describes how meaning can be undone.

LOW_REVERSIBILITY:
  - authority can be revoked cleanly
  - no downstream meaning relies on result

MEDIUM_REVERSIBILITY:
  - downstream meaning exists
  - invalidation required but bounded

HIGH_REVERSIBILITY_COST:
  - downstream meaning is widespread
  - external systems or humans may have acted
  - revocation is partial or advisory only

RULE:
  Physical deletion is NOT reversibility.

---

# DEPENDENCY EVALUATION

DEPENDENCIES describe what must be true
for the action to be safe.

LOW_DEPENDENCY:
  - existing permissions already granted
  - no new scope introduced

MEDIUM_DEPENDENCY:
  - relies on contextual assumptions
  - relies on recent but mutable state

HIGH_DEPENDENCY:
  - requires new permission grant
  - depends on human judgment
  - depends on external system state

---

# OUTCOME SELECTION RULES

WHEN:
  RISK_LEVEL == LOW

THEN:
  OUTCOME:
    APPROVE

---

WHEN:
  RISK_LEVEL == MEDIUM

THEN:
  OUTCOME:
    PARTIAL_APPROVE

PARTIAL_APPROVE_MEANS:
  - narrowed scope
  - reduced output authority
  - explicit constraints added
  - revalidation required before commit

---

WHEN:
  RISK_LEVEL == HIGH

THEN:
  OUTCOME:
    ESCALATE

ESCALATE_MEANS:
  - execution is paused
  - no authority is granted
  - human confirmation required

---

WHEN:
  justification is missing OR
  invariants cannot be proven safe

THEN:
  OUTCOME:
    REJECT

---

# ESCALATION CONSTRAINTS

RULE:
  ESCALATE must NOT become a bypass.

REQUIRED:
  - explicit reviewer identity
  - explicit approval artifact
  - bounded approval scope
  - expiry window on approval
  - audit record

FORBIDDEN:
  - implicit approval
  - reused approvals
  - open-ended authority

---

# INVARIANTS

INVARIANT:
  Uncertainty must reduce power, not increase it.

INVARIANT:
  No trusted meaning is created by default.

INVARIANT:
  Validation must be explainable after the fact.
