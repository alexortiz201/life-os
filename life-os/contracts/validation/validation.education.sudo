# VALIDATION CONTRACT — EDUCATION

PURPOSE:
  Teach how to think about validation as a system boundary,
  not a correctness checker.

# CACHE WARM

WHAT_LAYER:
  RNA

UNIVERSAL_PROBLEM:
  Preventing unsafe or unauthorized actions
  from entering execution pipelines.

RECALL_HOOKS:
  MNEMONICS:
    - "Decide, don’t do"
    - "Permission ≠ belief"
    - "Approval is not truth"

  INVARIANT_REMINDERS:
    - Validation must be pure
    - Validation must be explainable
    - Validation must reduce power under uncertainty

  QUESTIONS:
    - What assumption is this checking?
    - What authority would leak if this were skipped?
    - What would silently corrupt if this guessed?

CONTEXT_SPECIFICITY:
  SYSTEMS
  AGENTS
  AI INTEGRATION

FAILURE_MODE:
  Silent permission escalation
  Execution of unjustified actions
  Invariants enforced too late

# MENTAL MODEL

MODEL:
  Validation is a filter, not a transformer.

EXPLANATION:
  Validation inspects meaning and authority
  but does not change the world.

ANALOGY:
  A security checkpoint does not fly the plane.
  It only decides who is allowed near it.

---

# COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS

MISCONCEPTION:
  "Validation should prepare execution."

CORRECTION:
  Validation must not plan or optimize.
  Planning belongs to a later stage.

MISCONCEPTION:
  "If validation passes, execution is safe."

CORRECTION:
  Validation is time-bound.
  Safety must be re-checked later.

---

# WHY THIS STAGE EXISTS

REASON:
  Execution is expensive and dangerous.
  Validation is cheap and preventative.

INSIGHT:
  Catching errors before execution
  prevents irreversible effects.

---

# FAILURE PATTERNS TO WATCH FOR

PATTERN:
  Validation performs side effects.

RESULT:
  Authority leaks before commit.

PATTERN:
  Validation guesses missing intent.

RESULT:
  The system lies on behalf of the actor.

PATTERN:
  Validation is skipped for "fast paths".

RESULT:
  Fast corruption instead of fast value.
