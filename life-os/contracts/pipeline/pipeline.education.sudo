# RNA PIPELINE — EDUCATION

PURPOSE:
  Teach the mental model for the RNA pipeline stages
  without mixing in implementation detail.

SCOPE:
  Explain:
    - what each stage is for
    - what each stage is NOT allowed to do
    - what “provisional” and “commit” mean

---

# CACHE WARM

WHAT_LAYER:
  RNA

UNIVERSAL_PROBLEM:
  Safe intent handling under changing context:
    - prevent silent authority escalation
    - prevent stale assumptions becoming truth
    - keep “effects” separate from “belief”

RECALL_HOOKS:
  MNEMONICS:
    - "Validate, Execute, Commit"
    - "Try is not truth"
    - "Effects first, belief last"

  INVARIANT REMINDERS:
    - Nothing trusted by accident
    - Execution may change the world, not belief
    - Commit is the only trust boundary

  QUESTIONS:
    - What is allowed to change here: world, records, or belief?
    - If we stop after this stage, did anything become trusted?
    - What could drift between now and commit?

CONTEXT_SPECIFICITY:
  SYSTEMS
  AGENTS
  AI_INTEGRATION

FAILURE_MODE:
  Silent corruption via stale context
  Authority leaks via premature trust
  Audit gaps that prevent debugging

# STAGE PURPOSES

PROPOSAL INTAKE:
  PURPOSE:
    Turn raw intent into a stable fact the system can reason about.
  NOT_ALLOWED:
    Decide anything.
    Helpfully “fix” meaning.
  OUTPUT:
    A frozen proposal record.

VALIDATION:
  PURPOSE:
    Decide whether the proposed action is allowed right now.
  NOT_ALLOWED:
    Produce effects.
    Create trusted outputs.
  OUTPUT:
    A decision record.

PLANNING:
  PURPOSE:
    Convert an approved decision into an explicit step sequence.
  NOT_ALLOWED:
    Execute steps.
  OUTPUT:
    An execution plan.

EXECUTION:
  PURPOSE:
    Perform the planned steps and record what happened.
  NOT_ALLOWED:
    Make the system believe it happened.
  OUTPUT:
    Effects log + results (provisional).

RE VALIDATION:
  PURPOSE:
    Re check whether commit is still justified right now.
  NOT_ALLOWED:
    Execute more.
    Commit.
  OUTPUT:
    Commit decision.

COMMIT:
  PURPOSE:
    Cross the trust boundary:
      - publish meaning
      - promote outputs
      - update system belief
  NOT_ALLOWED:
    Execute new work.
  OUTPUT:
    A commit record (the system now stands behind the meaning).

---

# KEY DEFINITIONS

PROVISIONAL:
  Effects that exist but are not trusted as meaning.

COMMIT:
  The moment the system agrees to believe and act on new meaning.

RE VALIDATION:
  A second check because context and permissions can change during execution.

---

# SUPER SIMPLE

SUMMARY:
  Write it down.
  Decide if it’s allowed.
  Plan it.
  Try it.
  Check again.
  Then believe it.
