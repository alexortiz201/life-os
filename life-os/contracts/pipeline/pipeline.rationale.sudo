# RNA PIPELINE — RATIONALE

PURPOSE:
  Capture why the pipeline is staged this way
  and what silent failures it prevents.

SCOPE:
  This file explains tradeoffs and “why not simpler”
  for future maintainers and future you.

---

# WHY STAGES MUST BE SEPARATE

REASON:
  Validation, execution, and commit solve different problems.

VALIDATION_SOLVES:
  "Is this allowed given what we know now?"

EXECUTION_SOLVES:
  "What happened when we tried?"

COMMIT_SOLVES:
  "Does the system now believe and stand behind this meaning?"

RISK_IF_MERGED:
  - validation + execution merge creates accidental side effects
  - execution + commit merge creates accidental trust escalation
  - commit without re checking creates stale truth

---

# WHY RE VALIDATION EXISTS

ASSUMPTION:
  Time does not stand still.

CHANGES_THAT_CAN_HAPPEN_DURING_EXECUTION:
  - permissions revoked
  - invariants updated
  - target state changed
  - dependencies drift
  - scope rules tightened

RISK_WITHOUT_RE VALIDATION:
  The system commits meaning that was allowed earlier
  but is no longer justified now.

---

# WHY INTAKE MUST BE DUMB

INTAKE_GOAL:
  Make a stable record.

RISK_IF_INTAKE_TRIES_TO_HELP:
  - it infers intent incorrectly
  - it mutates meaning before validation
  - it creates unreviewable, irreproducible proposals

DESIGN_OUTCOME:
  Intake is replayable and deterministic.

---

# WHY PLANNING IS A STAGE

REASON:
  "Approve" is not a plan.

PLANNING_MAKES_EXPLICIT:
  - step order
  - dependency requirements
  - scope boundaries
  - failure points

RISK_IF_SKIPPED:
  Execution becomes improvisation,
  which is where invariants silently get bypassed.

---

# WHY COMMIT MUST BE ATOMIC

REASON:
  Partial belief is silent corruption.

ATOMICITY_PREVENTS:
  - half published meaning
  - inconsistent trust levels
  - “some outputs trusted, some not” without explicit record

DESIGN_OUTCOME:
  Either the system believes all the approved meaning,
  or it believes none of it.

---

# WHY AUDIT LINKS ARE REQUIRED

REASON:
  Without linkage, you cannot debug authority leaks.

LINKAGE_ENSURES:
  - replayability
  - provenance
  - accountability
  - the ability to revoke trust correctly

RISK_IF_MISSING:
  Meaning drifts with no trace,
  and the system cannot explain itself.

---

# TRADEOFFS ACCEPTED

TRADEOFF 1:
  More records and more ceremony
  in exchange for fewer silent failures.

TRADEOFF 2:
  Re validation cost
  in exchange for correctness under drift.

TRADEOFF 3:
  Provisional outputs complexity
  in exchange for separating effects from belief.
