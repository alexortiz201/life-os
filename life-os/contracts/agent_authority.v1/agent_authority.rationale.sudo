# AGENT AUTHORITY CONTRACT — RATIONALE

PURPOSE:
  Capture why these constraints exist
  and what breaks if we loosen them.

---

# WHY THIS CONTRACT EXISTS

PROBLEM:
  Agents are persuasive.
  Without explicit authority boundaries, "helpful" becomes corruption.

GOAL:
  Make it impossible for an agent to:
    - create trusted meaning by accident
    - expand its own permissions
    - act indefinitely without re-authorization

---

# KEY CHOICES AND TRADEOFFS

CHOICE:
  Agents may only PROPOSE.

TRADEOFF:
  - slower than autonomous execution
  + prevents silent trust escalation

CHOICE:
  Grants must EXPIRE.

TRADEOFF:
  - adds renewal overhead
  + prevents forgotten long-lived authority

CHOICE:
  Bounds must be explicit.

TRADEOFF:
  - more configuration
  + prevents ambiguous "maybe allowed" interpretations

CHOICE:
  Stop conditions are strict.

TRADEOFF:
  - more halts and escalations
  + eliminates "try anyway" failure cascades

# FAILURE MODES IF WRONG

IF agents can execute:
  - validation becomes optional in practice
  - execution produces belief implicitly
  - undo becomes physical deletion instead of semantic revocation

IF grants do not expire:
  - stale permission becomes permanent
  - attacks and mistakes have unlimited time

IF bounds are implicit:
  - scope creep becomes automatic
  - the system cannot prove why an action was allowed

IF audit is incomplete:
  - the system loses accountability
  - trust cannot be revoked safely

---

# CONNECTION TO PIPELINE

LINK:
  The pipeline is safe only if:
    - PROPOSAL is attributable to a grant
    - VALIDATION can fail closed
    - COMMIT is the only trust boundary

STATEMENT:
  Authority is a prerequisite for proposing.
  Validation is a prerequisite for execution.
  Re-validation is a prerequisite for commit.
