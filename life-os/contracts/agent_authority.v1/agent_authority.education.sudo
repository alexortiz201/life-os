# AGENT AUTHORITY CONTRACT — EDUCATION

PURPOSE:
  Teach the human what problem "agent authority" solves
  and how to reason about it under stress.

# CACHE WARM

WHAT_LAYER:
  RNA

UNIVERSAL_PROBLEM:
  Delegation without silent authority escalation.

RECALL_HOOKS:
  MNEMONICS:
    - "Delegate ≠ Trust"
    - "Grant is a leash"
    - "Agents propose, system disposes"
    - "No grant, no voice"

  INVARIANT_REMINDERS:
    - An agent can’t approve itself
    - Expiry is required
    - Missing bound means not allowed
    - Stop beats speed

  QUESTIONS:
    - What is this agent allowed to touch?
    - What must it never be able to do?
    - How does permission end?
    - What happens mid-flight if permission is revoked?

CONTEXT SPECIFICITY:
  AGENTS
  AI INTEGRATION
  SYSTEMS

FAILURE_MODE:
  Silent authority escalation
  Unbounded background action
  "Looks fine" logs that hide who authorized it

# MENTAL MODEL

MODEL:
  A grant is a signed capability.

MEANS:
  - The agent is allowed to speak (propose)
  - The system still decides (validate + commit)
  - The grant limits what can be spoken about (targets, scopes, selectors)
  - The grant ends (expires) even if nobody remembers

🍰 SUPER SIMPLE:
  A grant is a leash.
  No leash, no walking.
  Even with a leash, you still ask before you cross the street.

# COMMON CONFUSIONS

CONFUSION:
  "If the agent has permission, why not let it execute?"

ANSWER:
  Permission to propose is not permission to commit.
  Execution changes the world.
  Commit changes belief.
  Agents must never change belief directly.

CONFUSION:
  "Why require expiry?"

ANSWER:
  Indefinite permission becomes invisible risk.
  Expiry forces re-justification.

CONFUSION:
  "Why 'missing bound means not allowed'?"

ANSWER:
  Default-open creates accidental power.
  Default-closed prevents silent drift.

# HOW THIS SHOWS UP IN REAL SYSTEMS

EXAMPLES:
  - API keys with scopes and expiry
  - OAuth tokens with audiences and lifetimes
  - CI/CD roles that can propose changes but require review to merge
  - Database users allowed to read but not write
