PURPOSE:
  Define the canonical set of agent roles used by Life-OS.
  Make responsibilities, allowed actions, stop conditions, and escalation triggers explicit.

SCOPE:
  This file defines:
    - role definitions
    - authority boundaries (conceptual)
    - required inputs and allowed outputs
    - stop conditions and escalation triggers

  This file does NOT define:
    - per-role implementation
    - tool wiring (MCP, APIs)
    - storage layout
    - UI behavior
