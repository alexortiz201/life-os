# PLANNING CONTRACT — SPEC

PURPOSE:
  Define how an approved proposal is transformed
  into an explicit, bounded execution plan.

ROLE:
  Planning converts permission into a concrete sequence of steps
  without executing, mutating state, or escalating trust.

SCOPE:
  This contract governs ONLY planning.
  It does NOT define validation, execution, or commit behavior.

---

# STAGE DEFINITION

STAGE:
  NAME: PLANNING
  POSITION: Third stage in RNA execution pipeline

RULE:
  Planning describes how an action would occur,
  not whether it should occur or that it did occur.

---

# INPUTS

INPUT:
  PROPOSAL_RECORD
  VALIDATION_DECISION (APPROVE or PARTIAL_APPROVE)

CONTEXT_INPUTS:
  - validation constraints
  - scope boundaries
  - dependency availability
  - system capabilities snapshot

RULE:
  Planning must honor all validation constraints verbatim.
  Planning may not relax or reinterpret them.

---

# OUTPUTS

OUTPUT:
  EXECUTION_PLAN

EXECUTION_PLAN_MUST_CONTAIN:
  - plan_id
  - ordered execution steps
  - required dependencies per step
  - expected side effects per step
  - scope boundaries per step
  - rollback / compensation notes (if applicable)
  - plan fingerprint
  - attribution metadata
  - creation timestamp

RULE:
  The plan must be explicit enough
  that execution does not need to infer intent.

---

# RESPONSIBILITIES

THIS_STAGE_MUST:
  - translate intent into explicit steps
  - bind steps to validated scope
  - surface missing dependencies
  - surface ambiguity explicitly
  - produce a deterministic plan artifact

THIS_STAGE_MUST_NOT:
  - execute any step
  - mutate system state
  - create trusted artifacts
  - escalate authority
  - reinterpret validation outcomes
  - “fill in” missing intent

RULE:
  Planning is descriptive, not creative.

---

# FAILURE BEHAVIOR

FAILURE_ALLOWED_ONLY_IF:
  - no safe execution sequence exists
  - required dependencies are unavailable
  - validation constraints cannot be honored
  - intent is underspecified for execution

FAILURE_MODE:
  FAIL_CLOSED

FAILURE_MEANS:
  - no execution occurs
  - proposal does not advance
  - explicit failure reason is recorded

---

# STAGE INVARIANTS

INVARIANT_1:
  Planning produces no side effects.

INVARIANT_2:
  Planning does not change meaning or trust.

INVARIANT_3:
  Every execution step must be attributable to proposal intent.

INVARIANT_4:
  Identical inputs produce identical plans.

---

# TRUST MODEL

TRUST_LEVEL:
  UNTRUSTED

RULE:
  A plan is not permission.
  A plan is not execution.
  A plan is not belief.

---

# HANDOFF CONTRACT

HANDOFF_TO:
  EXECUTION_STAGE

HANDOFF_GUARANTEES:
  - execution does not need to infer intent
  - scope and constraints are explicit
  - plan can be audited independently

RULE:
  Execution may fail,
  but must never reinterpret the plan.

---

# ONE LINE SPINE

STATEMENT:
  "Planning turns permission into instructions,
   without changing the world."

---

# SUPER SIMPLE

SUMMARY:
  Spell it out.
  Don’t do it.
  Don’t believe it.
