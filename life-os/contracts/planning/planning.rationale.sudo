# PLANNING CONTRACT — RATIONALE

PURPOSE:
  Capture why planning is a distinct, explicit,
  and non-executing stage.

---

# DESIGN COMMITMENTS

COMMITMENT_1:
  Planning is separate from validation.

RATIONALE:
  Validation judges permission.
  Planning translates permission into steps.

---

COMMITMENT_2:
  Planning produces a durable artifact.

RATIONALE:
  Without a plan artifact,
  execution cannot be audited or constrained.

---

COMMITMENT_3:
  Planning absorbs ambiguity early.

RATIONALE:
  Ambiguity during execution
  forces unsafe decisions under pressure.

---

COMMITMENT_4:
  Planning is deterministic.

RATIONALE:
  Non-deterministic plans
  make failures unreproducible.

---

# REJECTED ALTERNATIVES

REJECTED:
  "Planning inside execution"

REASON:
  Execution failures become indistinguishable
  from planning mistakes.

---

REJECTED:
  "Implicit plans inferred by executors"

REASON:
  Executors should not reason about intent.

---

REJECTED:
  "Auto-correcting plans"

REASON:
  Guessing intent violates attribution
  and reversibility.

---

# SYSTEM CONSEQUENCES

IF PLANNING IS SKIPPED:
  Execution becomes creative.

IF PLANNING IS WEAK:
  Execution leaks authority.

IF PLANNING IS STRONG:
  Execution becomes simple and safe.

---

# LONG-TERM PAYOFF

BENEFIT:
  Clear blame boundaries.

BENEFIT:
  Deterministic execution behavior.

BENEFIT:
  Safe agent participation.

BENEFIT:
  Easier rollback and auditing.

---

# FINAL ASSERTION

STATEMENT:
  Planning exists so execution never has to think.
