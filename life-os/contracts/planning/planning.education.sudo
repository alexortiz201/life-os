# PLANNING CONTRACT — EDUCATION

PURPOSE:
  Teach how to separate “what is allowed”
  from “how it would actually happen”.

---

# CACHE WARM

WHAT_LAYER:
  RNA

UNIVERSAL_PROBLEM:
  Preventing execution systems from improvising intent.

RECALL_HOOKS:
  MNEMONICS:
    - "Plan ≠ Act"
    - "Describe, don’t perform"
    - "No inference at runtime"

  INVARIANT_REMINDERS:
    - Execution should be dumb
    - Planning absorbs ambiguity
    - Underspecified plans are unsafe

  QUESTIONS:
    - Could execution run without thinking?
    - Is every step justified by intent?
    - What breaks if this plan is wrong?

CONTEXT_SPECIFICITY:
  SYSTEMS
  AGENTS
  AI INTEGRATION

FAILURE_MODE:
  Execution guessing intent
  Scope drift during execution
  Authority escalation via convenience

# MENTAL MODEL

MODEL:
  Planning is pre-commit rehearsal.

EXPLANATION:
  Planning exists so execution
  never has to decide what to do next.

ANALOGY:
  A flight plan is not flying.
  It exists so pilots don’t improvise midair.

---

# WHY PLANNING IS SEPARATE

REASON:
  Execution is dangerous and irreversible.
  Planning is safe and reversible.

INSIGHT:
  Every decision pushed earlier
  reduces risk later.

# COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS

MISCONCEPTION:
  "Execution can plan as it goes."

CORRECTION:
  Runtime planning is hidden authority escalation.

MISCONCEPTION:
  "Planning is just an optimization step."

CORRECTION:
  Planning is a safety boundary.

MISCONCEPTION:
  "If validation passed, planning is trivial."

CORRECTION:
  Validation permits.
  Planning operationalizes.

# FAILURE PATTERNS TO WATCH FOR

PATTERN:
  Planning introduces new intent.

RESULT:
  The system acts on meaning never proposed.

PATTERN:
  Planning hides ambiguity.

RESULT:
  Execution guesses under pressure.

PATTERN:
  Planning adapts at runtime.

RESULT:
  Invariants erode silently.
