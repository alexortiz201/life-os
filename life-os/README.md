# Life-OS — The Adaptive Operating System for Humans

Life-OS is a learning-first AI system built phase by phase with explicit intent,
constraints, and traceable decisions.

Where many projects optimize for features, Life-OS optimizes for deep understanding:
you should be able to design, build, debug, and evolve AI systems end-to-end and
explain why every part exists and how it fails.

---

## What Life-OS Is

Life-OS exists to surface real systems thinking through real engineering.

Learning is the primary output.
Software is the medium.

---

## Repository Structure

Life-OS is developed in explicit phases, each with clear intent, decisions,
and documented learnings.

```

## Architecture

DNA → RNA → Expression

DNA: semantic structure and meaning
RNA: interpretation and transformation
Expression: human-facing artifacts

---

## Getting Started

1. Read intent_and_constraints.sudo
2. Read roadmap.sudo
3. Start with phases/phase_0_foundations

---

## Snapshot Workflow

Each completed phase is preserved with Git tags to keep learning immutable.

---

## Success Criteria

- Clear system reasoning
- Explicit tradeoffs
- Ability to explain, modify, and debug end-to-end
- Transferable expertise
