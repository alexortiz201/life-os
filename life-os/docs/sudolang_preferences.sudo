# Sudolang Styling Preferences

PURPOSE:
  Define how Sudolang documents should be written
  to maximize scanability, consistency, and intent clarity
  for both humans and AI.

GOAL:
  Make structure obvious without visual noise.
  Let syntax carry meaning, not styling tricks.

---

# CORE CONVENTIONS

- Colons (:) define structure and intent.
- Indentation defines scope and containment.
- Underscores (_) join multi-word labels ONLY when:
    - the label is ALL CAPS
    - the label precedes a colon
- Backticks (``) constrain or qualify a phrase.
- Headings (#) mark major section boundaries only.
- Every major section boundary MUST use:
    ---
    # SECTION TITLE

---

# HEADINGS

USE headings ONLY for:
  - major sections
  - contracts
  - indexes
  - mode boundaries

AVOID headings for:
  - routine structure
  - steps
  - labels

EXAMPLES:
  # STORY INDEX
  # REVIEW ROTATION STRATEGY

---

# LABELS

LABELS MUST:
  - be ALL CAPS
  - end with a colon
  - use underscores if multi-word

PREFERRED:

  PER_STORY_FILE_TEMPLATE:

  Usage Rules:
  Story Index:

STRUCTURE comes from:
  - capitalization
  - colons
  - indentation

NOT from headings.

---

# CONDITIONALS AND RULES

EXPRESS conditionals as labels,
not as prose sentences.

PREFERRED:
  WHEN: `user requests behavioral practice`
  THEN:
    EXPECT:
      - explicit story selection

  IF no module is provided THEN
    proceed without it

AVOID:
  When the user requests behavioral practice, then...

BACKTICKS (``) MUST be used to:
  - constrain meaning
  - quote conditions
  - mark literals
  - specify exact triggers

---

# UNDERSCORES VS SPACES

USE SPACES for:
  - titles
  - human-facing names
  - quoted phrases
  - headings

EXAMPLE:
  "Experiment Interference / Composition Fix"

USE UNDERSCORES for:
  - identifiers
  - stable references
  - machine-facing keys
  - ALL-CAPS multi-word labels preceding a colon

EXAMPLE:
  STORY_1:
  USAGE_RULES:
  PER_STORY_FILE_TEMPLATE:
  REVIEW_ROTATION_STRATEGY:

---

# STORY IDENTIFIERS

STORY identifiers MUST:
  - be ALL CAPS
  - use underscores
  - be stable
  - be referenceable

EXAMPLE:
  STORY_1: "Experiment Interference / Composition Fix"

STORY titles MUST:
  - be quoted
  - use natural language
  - never use underscores

---

# STEPS

STEPS MUST:
  - use plain-text labels
  - rely on numbering + colon
  - NOT be headings

PREFERRED:
  STEP_1:
  STEP_2:

AVOID:
  ## STEP 1
  ## STEP 2
  STEP 1
  STEP 2

STRUCTURE comes from:
  - numbering
  - indentation
  - consistent phrasing

---

# INDENTATION

INDENTATION is semantic.

RULES:
  - two spaces per level
  - deeper indentation implies containment
  - hierarchy comes from indentation, not punctuation

AVOID deep nesting unless it adds meaning.

---

# SEPARATORS

USE `---` ONLY to separate major sections.

DO NOT use separators for:
  - visual decoration
  - minor transitions

PREFER whitespace.

---

# QUOTES AND LITERALS

USE quotes ("") for:
  - human-facing titles
  - phrases meant to be spoken verbatim

USE backticks (``) for:
  - conditions
  - constraints
  - exact triggers
  - literal values

---

# WHAT TO AVOID

- Overusing headings
- Encoding meaning via color alone
- Using ALL CAPS for emphasis instead of structure
- Writing Sudolang like Markdown or code
- Adding symbols to compensate for weak structure

---

# MENTAL MODEL

WRITE Sudolang as if:
  - a tired human must scan it quickly
  - an AI must infer structure without guessing
  - the document may be consumed out of order

IF something needs highlighting,
THEN the structure is probably unclear.
