# Life-OS Roadmap

PURPOSE:
  Provide a clear, evolving path for building Life-OS
  while maximizing learning signal, mastery, and transfer.

RULE:
  This roadmap is directional, not fixed.
  Reordering is allowed when learning value improves.

CHECKBOXES indicate:
  - learning milestones
  - not feature completeness
  - not production readiness

GLOBAL ASSERTIONS:
  - safety precedes capability
  - observability precedes optimization
  - explanation precedes automation
  - trust is earned, not assumed

---

# PHASE_0: FOUNDATIONS & RESET

GOAL:
  Establish shared language, constraints, and a learning-first posture.

DELIVERABLES:
  [x] Life-OS intent & alignment locked
  [x] Sudolang conventions finalized
  [x] Teaching / cache-warm protocol defined
  [x] Learning vs product explicitly unified
  [x] Definition of “mastery” made explicit

SCAFFOLDING TOUCHED:
  - Problem framing as a first-class activity
  - Success defined before optimization
  - Learning artifacts treated as system outputs

EXIT_CRITERIA:
  You can explain:
    - what Life-OS optimizes for
    - why safety precedes capability
    - why learning artifacts are first-class

---

# PHASE_1: LIFE-OS DNA — SEMANTIC GENOME

GOAL:
  Define meaning, trust, and invariants independent of execution.

FOCUS:
  Ontology
  Authority
  Invariants
  Meaning lifecycle

DELIVERABLES:
  [x] Meaning vs storage separated
  [x] Trust levels defined (MEMORY → NOTE → ARTIFACT → DERIVED)
  [x] Invariants articulated in prose
  [x] Authority escalation rules identified
  [x] DNA/RNA/Expression mental model stabilized

SCAFFOLDING TOUCHED:
  - Ground truth definitions (pre-model)
  - Semantic stability independent of model choice
  - Foundations for prompt correctness and refusal reasoning

EXIT_CRITERIA:
  You can change meaning definitions
  without touching execution logic.

---

# PHASE_2: LIFE-OS RNA — SAFE ACTION & GOVERNANCE

GOAL:
  Define how meaning turns into action safely.

FOCUS:
  Proposals
  Validation
  Execution
  Re-validation
  Commit

CORE ASSERTIONS:
  - execution ≠ belief
  - belief only occurs at commit
  - silent corruption is the primary failure mode

DELIVERABLES:
  [x] Proposal intake contract
  [x] Validation contract
  [x] Planning contract
  [x] Execution contract
  [x] Re-validation contract
  [x] Commit contract
  [x] RNA pipeline spec
  [x] Weekly reflection paper-executed
  [x] Phase 2 fundamentals extracted

SCAFFOLDING TOUCHED:
  - Prompt evaluation boundaries (validation vs execution)
  - Refusal and constraint modeling
  - Early agent boundaries (without agents)
  - Model outputs treated as untrusted inputs

EXIT_CRITERIA:
  You can explain:
    - why execution ≠ belief
    - why re-validation exists
    - how silent corruption happens

---

# PHASE_3: RNA — CONCRETE CONTROL FLOW

GOAL:
  Implement a minimal, correct execution kernel
  that enforces RNA contracts.

FOCUS:
  Determinism
  Stage isolation
  Type safety
  Runtime enforcement

DELIVERABLES:
  [ ] In-memory pipeline implementation (TypeScript)
  [ ] Zod schemas for all stage artifacts
  [ ] Stage-level invariant enforcement
  [ ] Full audit trail wiring
  [ ] One workflow fully runnable (weekly reflection)

SCAFFOLDING TOUCHED:
  - System observability primitives
  - Error classification and traceability
  - Measurement points for latency, correctness, and cost (not optimized)

NON-GOALS:
  - persistence
  - performance
  - UI polish
  - agent swarms

EXIT_CRITERIA:
  You can trace intent → commit in code
  and point to where every invariant is enforced.

---

# PHASE_3A: MINIMAL IMPLEMENTATION SCAFFOLDING  // OPTION A (NEXT)

GOAL:
  Make RNA concrete without adding behavior.

FOCUS:
  Types
  Schemas
  Shape correctness

DELIVERABLES:
  [ ] TypeScript interfaces for all pipeline artifacts
  [ ] Zod schemas enforcing contract boundaries
  [ ] Explicit invariant checks at stage boundaries
  [ ] Zero business logic beyond enforcement

LEARNING_SIGNAL:
  Specs become executable shapes.
  Safety becomes tangible.
  Runtime guards revealed invariants that types alone cannot enforce.

EXIT_CRITERIA:
  You can build any stage confidently
  because its contract is enforced by types.

---

# PHASE_3B: TRIGGERS & DERIVATION WORKFLOWS  // OPTION B

GOAL:
  Make derivation explicit, auditable, and safe.

FOCUS:
  Trigger → Proposal creation
  Derivation as a first-class workflow
  Drift prevention

DELIVERABLES:
  [ ] Trigger catalog (what can start a proposal)
  [ ] Trigger-to-proposal policy rules
  [ ] Derivation intent definitions (DERIVE_*)
  [ ] Enforcement that DERIVED meaning always comes from a proposal
  [ ] Audit linkage from source → derived artifacts

SCAFFOLDING TOUCHED:
  - Event-driven reasoning
  - RAG as a derivation source (not authority)
  - Retrieval treated as evidence, not truth

EXIT_CRITERIA:
  You can explain:
    - why derivation is not a pipeline step
    - how derived meaning stays honest over time

---

# PHASE_3C: VALIDATION RISK & ESCALATION POLICY  // OPTION C

GOAL:
  Formalize how uncertainty reduces power.

FOCUS:
  Fail-closed behavior
  Escalation rules
  Human-in-the-loop boundaries

DELIVERABLES:
  [ ] Validation risk policy contract
  [ ] Explicit escalation triggers
  [ ] Human confirmation semantics
  [ ] Governor-agent enforcement rules

EXIT_CRITERIA:
  You can explain exactly:
    - when the system must stop
    - when it must escalate
    - when it is allowed to proceed narrowly

---

# PHASE_4: EXPRESSION — OBSERVABILITY FIRST

  Non-authoritative extensibility

DELIVERABLES:
  [ ] Theme plugin interface

  Integrate AI tools without surrendering control.

FOCUS:
  Tool contracts
  Failure handling
