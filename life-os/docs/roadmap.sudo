# Life-OS Roadmap

PURPOSE:
  Provide a clear, evolving path for building Life-OS
  while maximizing learning signal, mastery, and transfer.

RULE:
  This roadmap is directional, not fixed.
  Reordering is allowed when learning value improves.

CHECKBOXES indicate:
  - learning milestones
  - not feature completeness
  - not production readiness

---

# PHASE_0: FOUNDATIONS & RESET

GOAL:
  Establish shared language, constraints, and a learning-first posture.

DELIVERABLES:
  [x] Life-OS intent & alignment locked
  [x] Sudolang conventions finalized
  [x] Teaching / cache-warm protocol defined
  [x] Learning vs product explicitly unified
  [x] Definition of “mastery” made explicit

EXIT_CRITERIA:
  You can explain:
    - what Life-OS optimizes for
    - why safety precedes capability
    - why learning artifacts are first-class

---

# PHASE_1: LIFE-OS DNA — SEMANTIC GENOME

GOAL:
  Define meaning, trust, and invariants independent of execution.

FOCUS:
  Ontology
  Authority
  Invariants
  Meaning lifecycle

DELIVERABLES:
  [x] Meaning vs storage separated
  [x] Trust levels defined (MEMORY → NOTE → ARTIFACT)
  [x] Invariants articulated in prose
  [x] Authority escalation rules identified
  [x] DNA/RNA/Expression mental model stabilized

EXIT_CRITERIA:
  You can change meaning definitions
  without touching execution logic.

---

# PHASE_2: LIFE-OS RNA — SAFE ACTION & GOVERNANCE

GOAL:
  Define how meaning turns into action safely.

FOCUS:
  Proposals
  Validation
  Execution
  Re-validation
  Commit

DELIVERABLES:
  [x] Proposal intake contract
  [x] Validation contract
  [x] Planning contract
  [x] Execution contract
  [x] Re-validation contract
  [x] Commit contract
  [x] RNA pipeline spec
  [x] Weekly reflection paper-executed
  [x] Phase 2 fundamentals extracted

EXIT_CRITERIA:
  You can explain:
    - why execution ≠ belief
    - why re-validation exists
    - how silent corruption happens

---

# PHASE_3: RNA — CONCRETE CONTROL FLOW (CURRENT)

GOAL:
  Implement a minimal, correct execution kernel
  that enforces RNA contracts.

FOCUS:
  Determinism
  Stage isolation
  Type safety
  Runtime enforcement

DELIVERABLES:
  [ ] In-memory pipeline implementation (TypeScript)
  [ ] Zod schemas for all stage artifacts
  [ ] Stage-level invariant enforcement
  [ ] Full audit trail wiring
  [ ] One workflow fully runnable (weekly reflection)

NON-GOALS:
  - persistence
  - performance
  - UI polish
  - agent swarms

EXIT_CRITERIA:
  You can trace intent → commit in code
  and point to where every invariant is enforced.

---

# PHASE_4: EXPRESSION — OBSERVABILITY FIRST

GOAL:
  Make the system legible before making it powerful.

FOCUS:
  Transparency
  Explanation
  Debuggability

INITIAL_POSTURE:
  Expression is READ-ONLY.

DELIVERABLES:
  [ ] Proposal viewer
  [ ] Decision viewer
  [ ] Execution trace viewer
  [ ] Commit history
  [ ] Provenance graphs

NOTE:
  Expression becomes participatory ONLY after
  RNA safety is proven.

EXIT_CRITERIA:
  A human understands system state
  without reading code or guessing.

---

# PHASE_5: EXTENSIBILITY — THEMES FIRST

GOAL:
  Allow extension without authority leakage.

FOCUS:
  Theming
  Presentation plugins
  Non-authoritative extensibility

DELIVERABLES:
  [ ] Theme plugin interface
  [ ] Theme isolation guarantees
  [ ] Proof that themes cannot alter authority
  [ ] Safe rendering hooks

RULE:
  Themes may influence presentation only.
  Never validation, execution, or commit.

EXIT_CRITERIA:
  Third-party extensions cannot corrupt meaning.

---

# PHASE_6: MCP & TOOL INTEGRATION

GOAL:
  Integrate AI tools without surrendering control.

FOCUS:
  Tool contracts
  Failure handling
  Latency & cost awareness

DELIVERABLES:
  [ ] MCP server integration
  [ ] Tool calls wrapped as proposals
  [ ] Tool failures modeled explicitly
  [ ] Tool outputs treated as untrusted input

EXIT_CRITERIA:
  Tool failures feel boring, not dangerous.

---

# PHASE_7: AGENTIC SYSTEMS

GOAL:
  Introduce long-lived reasoning safely.

FOCUS:
  Agent roles
  Stop conditions
  Planning loops

DELIVERABLES:
  [ ] Agent role definitions
  [ ] Agent state machine
  [ ] Planning → execution loop
  [ ] Explicit stop conditions
  [ ] Escalation triggers

EXIT_CRITERIA:
  You trust agents because you know when they stop.

---

# PHASE_8: MULTI-USER & HUMAN ESCALATION

GOAL:
  Support multiple users and expert intervention.

FOCUS:
  Attribution
  Human authority
  Expert escalation

DELIVERABLES:
  [ ] Multi-user identity model
  [ ] Escalation routing rules
  [ ] Expert role definitions
  [ ] Human override semantics
  [ ] Auditability across users

EXIT_CRITERIA:
  Authority is clear even with humans in the loop.

---

# PHASE_9: TEACHING & ADAPTIVE LEARNING

GOAL:
  Teach users how to think, not just what to do.

FOCUS:
  Learning transfer
  Personalized guidance
  Reflection quality

DELIVERABLES:
  [ ] Teaching engine scaffolding
  [ ] Learning signal tracking
  [ ] Adaptive prompting
  [ ] Fundamentals review rotation
  [ ] Explanation quality feedback

EXIT_CRITERIA:
  The system improves how users reason over time.

---

# CONTINUOUS TRACKS

ALWAYS_ON:
  - Fundamentals review (morning / night)
  - Explanation practice
  - System articulation

MEASURE_PROGRESS_BY:
  - clarity under pressure
  - safe modification ability
  - comfort with ambiguity
