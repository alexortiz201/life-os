# Life-OS - Intent & Constraints

PURPOSE:
  Build a complex AI-first system end-to-end
  to develop deep, transferable systems expertise.

GOAL:
  Become someone who can design, build, debug,
  and evolve AI-powered systems with confidence,
  clarity, and correctness under ambiguity.

SUCCESS is measured by:
  - depth of understanding
  - ability to explain systems clearly
  - ability to build systems that do not collapse under uncertainty
  - number of meaningful concepts touched
  - external validation (grants, trust, references, adoption)

---

# PRIMARY INTENT

Life-OS exists to:
  - teach system design through real construction
  - force tradeoff awareness at every layer
  - expose real AI integration constraints
  - build intuition that cannot be gained through tutorials alone

The system is designed as:
  - a learning accelerator
  - a systems-thinking gym
  - a long-lived experiment in applied AI architecture

Learning is the first-order objective.
The product is secondary.

---

# WHAT LIFE-OS IS NOT

Life-OS is NOT:
  - a “build everything cool” playground
  - a speed-focused prototype
  - a shallow portfolio project
  - a feature-first app
  - a shortcut to external validation

Life-OS does NOT optimize for:
  - rapid shipping without understanding
  - novelty without purpose
  - skipping tradeoffs
  - hiding complexity behind abstractions

---

# CORE DESIGN RULE

EVERY new concept MUST earn its place.

A feature MAY be added ONLY IF it teaches:
  - MCP mechanics
  - agent coordination
  - state management under uncertainty
  - real AI integration constraints
  - failure modes and recovery paths

IF a feature does NOT teach something concrete
that cannot be learned more directly elsewhere
THEN it does not belong yet.

---

# LEARNING PHILOSOPHY

ASSUME:
  - mastery comes from repeated system exposure
  - understanding precedes optimization
  - correctness precedes cleverness

PREFER:
  - explicit workflows over magic
  - observable state over hidden state
  - boring, inspectable solutions
  - systems that fail loudly and informatively

AVOID:
  - abstracting away things you don’t yet understand
  - copying patterns without knowing why they exist
  - premature optimization
  - treating AI as a black box

---

# SCOPE BOUNDARIES

Life-OS WILL:
  - span frontend to data layer
  - include AI pipelines end-to-end
  - surface ambiguity instead of hiding it
  - evolve slowly and deliberately

Life-OS WILL NOT:
  - aim for feature completeness early
  - chase market fit prematurely
  - attempt to cover all domains at once

---

# TIME & ENERGY CONSTRAINTS

ASSUME:
  - effort will vary day to day
  - progress may happen in bursts
  - interviews and job search run in parallel

DESIGN MUST:
  - allow meaningful progress in short sessions
  - support deep dives when time allows
  - preserve context across interruptions

Consistency matters more than speed.

---

# DOMAIN AWARENESS (NON-BINDING)

Life-OS MAY touch the following domains
WHEN it serves learning goals naturally:

  - Frontend Design
  - System / Distributed Design
  - Algorithms & Data Structures (conceptual)
  - TypeScript + React
  - LeetCode (pattern reinforcement only)
  - LLM Integrations
  - RAG Systems
  - Agentic Systems
  - MCP / Tooling Infrastructure
  - Blockchain
  - WASM

This list is NOT a checklist.
Coverage is opportunistic, not forced.

---

# KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER GOAL

The ultimate test of success:

  - You can explain any part of Life-OS
    to an engineer, employer, or client
    calmly, clearly, and precisely.

  - You can teach the system to your son
    and accelerate his understanding
    faster than you learned it yourself.

---

# FINAL CONSTRAINT

When in doubt:
  choose learning over shipping
  choose clarity over speed
  choose systems over features
